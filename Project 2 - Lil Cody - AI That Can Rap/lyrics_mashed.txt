[Verse]
Wait right here
I'll be back in the mornin'
I know that I'm not that important to you
But to me, girl, you're so much more than gorgeous (Yeah)
So much more than perfect (Yeah)
Right now I know that I'm not really worth it
If you give me time, I could work on it
Give me some time while I work on it
Losin' your patience, and, girl, I don't blame you
The Earth's in rotation, you're waitin' for me (Yeah)
Look at my face when I fuck on your waist
'Cause we only have one conversation a week
That's why your friends always hatin' on me
Fuck 'em though, I did this all by myself
Matter fact, I ain't never asked no one for help
And that's why I don't pick up my phone when it rings
None of my exes is over Lil Peep
Nobody flexin' as much as I be
That's why she text me and tell me she love me
She know that someday I'll be over the sea
Makin' my money and smokin' my weed
I think it's funny, she open up to me, get comfortable with me
Once I got it comin', I love her, she love me
I know that I'm nothing like someone her family want me to be
If I find a way, would you walk it with me?
Look at my face while you talkin' to me
'Cause we only have one conversation a week
Can I get one conversation at least?
Shout out to everyone makin' my beats, you helpin' me preach
This music's the only thing keepin' the peace when I'm fallin' to pieces

[Chorus]
Look at the sky tonight, all of the stars have a reason
A reason to shine, a reason like mine and I'm fallin' to pieces
Look at the sky tonight, all of the stars have a reason[Chorus]
Fuck my life, can't save that, girl
Don't tell me you could save that shit
All she want is payback for the way I always play that shit
You ain't gettin' nothin' that I'm sayin'
Don't tell me you is
Nothin' like them other motherfuckers
I can make you rich (I can make you rich)
I can make you this, baby, I can make you that
I can take you there, but baby, you won't make it back
Growing sick of this and I don't wanna make you sad
Do I make you scared? Baby, won't you take me back?

[Refrain]
Nothin' like them other motherfuckers
I can make you rich (I can make you rich)
Nothin' like them other motherfuckers
I can make you rich (I can make you rich)

[Chorus]
Fuck my life, can't save that, girl
Don't tell me you could save that shit
All she want is payback for the way I always play that shit
You ain't gettin' nothin' that I'm sayin'
Don't tell me you is
Nothin' like them other motherfuckers
I can make you rich (Make you rich)
I can make you this, baby, I can make you that
I can take you there, but baby, you won't make it back
Growing sick of this and I don't wanna make you sad
Do I make you scared? Baby, won't you take me back?
(Do I make you scared?)

[Bridge]
Down another lonely road, I go
Just another lonely road to home
I just wanna know, I just gotta know
Do you wanna glo? Baby, we could glo

[Chorus]
Fuck my life, can't save that, girl
Don't tell me you could save that shit
All she want is payback for the way I always play that shit
You ain't gettin' nothin' that I'm sayin'
Don't tell me you is
Nothin' like them other motherfuckers
I can make you rich (I can make you rich)
I can make you this, baby, I can make you that
I can take you there, but baby, you won't make it back
Growing sick of this and I don't wanna make you sad
Do I make you scared? Baby, won't you take me back?

[Outro]
Do I make you scared? Baby, won't you take me back?
Nothin' like them other mothafuckas'
I can make you rich (I can make you rich)[Intro]

Always wanna fuck 'cause I just came up, yeah

[Verse 1: Lil Tracy]
In high school, I was a loner
I was a reject, I was a poser
Multiple personalities, I'm bipolar
I swear, I mean well, I'm still goin' to hell
Witchcraft, love chants
Whisper in my ear, put me in a trance
Cocaine all night long
When I die, bury me with all my ice on
Witchcraft, love chants
Whisper in my ear, put me in a trance
Cocaine all night long
When I die, bury me with all my ice on

[Verse 2: Lil Peep]
When I die, bury me with all my ice on
When I die, bury me without the lights on
Lights off, nightlights
Clothes off, baby, I got good white
When I die, bury me with all my ice on
When I die, bury me without the lights on
Lights off, nightlights
Clothes off, baby, I got good white

[Verse 3: Lil Tracy]
Clothes off, baby, I got good white
Tell me a secret and I'll tell one of mines
I just wanna talk, I don't wanna fight
Ask me if I'm alright, do you want me to lie?

Everybody actin' real different and shit
Ain't nobody, nobody was talkin' to me like a few months ago
And now everybody hittin' my phone up and shit

I'm a mothafuckin' schema boy, I'm a dreamer boy
I love a girl that don't even fuckin' need a boy
Baby, I'm a beamer boy, I need a beamer, boy

Yeah, I'm in my zone now, I put my phone down

Ya girl, she wanna go down on a real one

You see me doin' shows now, I'm a pro now
I got hoes now and I got some dough now
But they don't wanna hear that, they want that real shit
They want that drug talk, that "I can't feel shit"
I'm never comin' home now, all alone now
Can't let my bros down, can't let my bros down
I feel like I'm a no one, that's what they told me
I'ma show ya, baby, I was chosen, ayy

Beamer boy[Intro: Lil Peep]
Bother me, tell me awful things
You know I love it when you do that
Helps me get through this without you

[Chorus: Lil Peep]
Bother me, tell me awful things
You know I love it when you do that
Helps me get through this without you
Bother me, tell me awful things
You know I love it when you move that on me
Love it when you do that on me

[Verse 1: Lil Peep]
You like attention, I find it obvious
She makes it obvious for me
She feels the tension
It's just the two of us, it's just the two of us, tonight
Burn me down 'til I'm nothin' but memories
I get it, girl (I get it, girl)
I get it, girl
Burn me down 'til I'm nothin' but memories
I get it, girl (I get it, girl)
I'm not the one

[Chorus: Lil Peep]
Bother me, tell me awful things
You know I love it when you do that
Helps me get through this without you
Bother me, tell me awful things
You know I love it when you move that on me
Love it when you do that on me

[Verse 2: Lil Tracy]
Don't you turn your back on me
Let your teardrops fall on me
Speeding away, the city in the rear view
Heart racing whenever I'm near you
GothBoi jumpin' off stage
Carry me away, carry me away
Burn me down 'til there's nothing left
I would scream your name with my last breath
Take off your favorite dress
Lay your head on my chest
Diamonds, rubies and gems
You can have all of them

[Chorus: Lil Peep]
Bother me, tell me awful things
You know I love it when you do that
Helps me get through this without you
Bother me, tell me awful things
You know I love it when you move that on me
Love it when you do that on me[Intro: Nedarb]
Skedda!

[Verse]
She said I'm a crybaby, I can't be up lately
Girl, you drive me crazy, AMG Mercedes
Speedin' down the highway, lookin' at the street lights
Geekin' on a Friday, I can never sleep right
Knowin' I hurt you, I don't deserve you
I shoulda curved you, I know I'm the worst, boo
But I could be cool too, and you got them dance moves
And I got this vibe, I swear it's perfect to ride to
I wanna die too, we all wanna die too
I got this vibe, I swear she love gettin' high too
I love gettin' high too, I wanna hide you
How did I find you? I'll be inside, I'm makin' music to cry to

[Chorus]
Oh, it's a lonely world, I know
Gon' get a lonely girl, that's fo' sho'
Oh, I'm a lonely boy, she made a lonely boy, yeah, I know
Oh, it's a lonely world, I know
Gon' get a lonely girl, that's fo' sho'
Oh, I'm a lonely boy, she made a lonely boy, yeah, I know

I got a feelin' that I'm not gonna be here for next year
So, let's laugh a little before I'm gone
I’ve been dreamin' of this shit for a while now
Got me high now
She don't love me, but she's singin' my songs (Oh, no)
I don't feel much pain
Got a knife in my back, and a bullet in my brain
I’m clinically insane
Walkin' home alone, I see faces in the rain
Where did all the time go?
Spend it gettin' high while I hide from the 5-0
Where did all the lines go?
Now, I'm so high, I be fuckin' with my eyes closed
She don't fuck with me no more, I'm on her mind though
Come and fuck me in the mornin' with the blinds closed
I can show you everything I learned
While you were away from me

[Chorus]
Runnin' away from me, but I'm not givin' up on you
It's just the way I be
It's just the way I see things
Take her away from me, but I'm not givin' up on you, no
It's just the way I be
It's just the way I see things[Intro: 
Hellboy Animated: Blood and Iron
 Sample]
Can this be him?
The one I have waited centuries to see?
How strange
So far from his path that I barely see the promise of glory
Can this be him, this Hellboy?

[Chorus]
You don't even know what I've been through (What I've been through)
You don't gotta like me, ya bitch do (Ya bitch do)
Blowin' up my phone like, "I miss you" (Like I miss you)
You know I love you by the way that I kiss you
You don't even know what I've been through (What I've been through)
You don't gotta like me, ya bitch do (Ya bitch do)
Blowin' up my phone like, "I miss you" (Like I miss you)
You know I love you by the way that I kiss you

[Verse]
Leave me to bleed, I know I got you on your knees
But something keeps on tellin' me
It keeps on tellin' me
"Peep, leave it alone, I'm good on my own"
Mama miss me at home, but I'm good on my own
Baby, I'm cold, back on the road
Show after show, fuckin' ho after ho
I swear it gets so lonely sometimes
Please, just hold me one time
Fuck these hoes and fuck life
I've been waitin' here all damn night
Not one call or text from you (Yeah, ayy)
You're the same as my ex, fuck you (Damn, ayy)
Bitch

[Chorus]
You don't even know what I've been through (What I've been through)
You don't gotta like me, ya bitch do (Ya bitch do)
Blowin' up my phone like, "I miss you" (Like I miss you)
You know I love you by the way that I kiss you
You don't even know what I've been through (What I've been through)
You don't gotta like me, ya bitch do (Ya bitch do)
Blowin' up my phone like, "I miss you" (Like I miss you)
You know I love you by the way that I kiss you[Verse]
I know that you want me, you know that I want you
The memories haunt me, I know that they haunt you too
But it's alright, you'll be fine
Baby, it's alright, you'll be fine
As long as you're mine, take a look at the time
It gets cold at night, when you're alone outside
But it's fine, I'll be fine
Pay me no mind, girl, pay me no mind

[Pre-Chorus]
Just look at the bright side (Just look at the bright side)
Just look at the club lights (Rollin' under the club lights)
I gotta look at the bright side (Look at the bright side)
I guess she wasn't the one, right, this isn't what love's like, that's for sure

[Chorus]
Help me find a way to pass the time (To pass the time)
Everybody tellin' me life's short, but I wanna die (I wanna die)
Help me find a way to make you mine (Make you mine)
Everybody tellin' me not to, but I'm gonna try
Now I'm gettin' high again, tonight

[Verse]
I know that you want me, you know that I want you
The memories haunt me, I know that they haunt you too
But it's alright, you'll be fine
Baby, it's alright, you'll be fine

It gets cold at night, when you're alone outside
But it's fine, I'll be fine
Pay me no mind, girl, pay me no mind

[Outro]
Just look at the bright side (Just look at the bright side)
Just look at the club lights (Rollin' under the club lights)
Just look at the nightlife (Just look at the nightlife)
Watchin' the sunrise by my side
We gotta look at the bright side (Just look at the bright side)
Rollin' under the club lights (Rollin' under the club lights)
I gotta look at the bright side (Just look at the bright side)
I guess she wasn't the one, right
This isn't what love's like
That's for sure[Intro]
Oh, this the one right here, Wicked?
Okay
Yeah, yeah
Run that back, Turbo

[Chorus]
We started off as close friends (Close friends)
Somehow you turned into my girlfriend (My girlfriend)
We used to tell each other everything (Everything)
I even went and bought her diamond rings, matching earrings
Everything was so cool (So cool)
Lately baby been actin' so rude (Been so rude)
I don't know what somebody told you (What they told you)
But I ain't gon' lie, I miss the old you

[Verse 1]
I know you remember how I would hold you
Still remember how I approached you
I think I loved you 'fore I knew you
Know we be fuckin' 'fore I screwed you
Made a promise I won't use you
Play my cards right, I won't lose you
Got 'em tuned in like I'm YouTube
Got somethin' on me like it's voodoo
I'll go nuts for you, go cuckoo, lose my cool and all
And I know that shit was wrong, I shouldn't've did what I did

[Verse 2]
Just wipe your eyes and stop this cryin'
I told the truth, that I'd been lyin'
I gave you racks, I tried to buy in
I even did the unthinkable, and I'm sorry for what I did to you
Take me back, if I was you and I did what I did
I probably would, I probably wouldn't
Take you back, if I was you and I did what I did
I probably would, I probably wouldn't
Just wipe your eyes and stop this cryin'
I told the truth, that I'd been lyin'
I gave you racks, I tried to buy in
I even did the unthinkable, and I'm sorry for what I did to you

[Chorus]
We started off as close friends (Close friends)
Somehow you turned into my girlfriend (My girlfriend)

But I ain't gon' lie, I miss the old you

[Verse 3]
Keep our business to ourselves
The internet ain't doin' no help
I know I shouldn't've never left
But everything I did for us
And us, I'm speakin' on my kids
Thinkin' 'bout this shit I did
Like how the hell I get myself involved in this bullshit?
Married to the game, I can't make you my fiancée
Bad young boss bitch, treat her like Beyoncé
But damn what them broads say, I fucked them all the first day
And that's why you trippin' anyway, like when I fuck 'em I don't pay
Even if we never speak again
I'll make sure you're ridin' in the latest Benz
Keep your business all apart if you can stay out of mine
Bought a brand new Audemars, but I done ran out of time

[Chorus]
We started off as close friends (Close friends)

Know what I'm saying? It's time to put this up
Yeah

[Verse]
Shoutout my label, that's me
I'm in this bitch with TB
I'm in this bitch with 4 Trey
I just poured up me an eight
Real nigga all in my face
Five hundred racks in my safe
Five hundred racks to the plug
What you know 'bout showin' love?
What you know 'bout pullin' up in Bentley trucks?
Make these bitches fall in love
All of my niggas on go
None of my niggas no hoes
All of my niggas want smoke
All of my niggas together
We came from the bottom, we used to wear each other's clothes
None of my niggas gon' fold
Couple pussy niggas told
They ain’t my niggas no more
Hold it down for the four
In the nine with the woes
Marlo my dawg, that's for sure
We won't fall out about shit
Specially not 'bout no bitch
We ain't gone fall out 'bout hoes
Me and Ced get them loads
We let 'em go for the low
I got my hood in control
I got my left wrist on froze
I got my right wrist on froze
I got my necklace on froze
Both of my ears on froze
I been gettin' faded, I'm sippin' on maple
If she won't fuck, I won't make her
I don't like bitches with makeup
If she want titties, I pay for 'em
Get outta there when I wake up
I pass the ball, I don't layup
I'm a big boss, I got say so
They'll wipe you down if I say so
Dracos, on Dracos, on Dracos, on Dracos
.40's, on .40's, on .40's
I just bought me some new water
Wetter than Katrina, shoutout New Orleans
I made a promise my niggas gon' ball
Hard in the paint, change my name to John Wall
Geekin' off trees like a leaf in the fall
Find a new plug then we takin' em all
Pull up in a brand new Benz truck
Hop out fresher than a menthol
Lil nigga, but I'm big dawg
All I gotta make is one call
Hit a nigga block, took off
Cross a nigga up, Hot Sauce
Ooh, I got 'em mad, my fault
Talkin' 'bout the shit that I bought
Poppin' these Percs, I done turned to a savage
Hundred racks stuffed in the mattress
Hundred racks stuffed in the attic
Hundred racks stuffed in the sofa
These niggas play gangster, but they won't approach me
I know they'll never approach me
They know that they'll catch a bullet
I rock the gang to the fullest
I run with some real ones, I don't hang with no pussies
I ain't no killer, don't push me
I see how you niggas be lookin'
I hope you don't think you no bully
I'm livin' the life, I should star in a movie
Ridin' in a Vert with an Uzi
12 get behind me, I lose 'em
They tryin' guess what I'm doin'
They tryin' guess who I'm screwin'
That ain't even they business
They ain't wanna fuck with me
Now they see a nigga drippin'
Now they wanna fuck with me
They can't get in touch with me
Hardly ever in the city
They just know I'm gettin' bigger
They just know a nigga busy
I been runnin' up them digits

[Verse 1]
Hundred thousand dollars on my neck
'Nother fifty thousand on my wrist
Every nigga with me real rich
Niggas havin' pressure 'bout a bitch
I got all my cases dismissed

Real niggas don't get into that

I ain't gotta sign no deal
Made a half a mil' last year
I just came home from the can
20 days, whole hundred bands
Got a nigga feelin' like the man
All these bitches knowin' who I am
Hit the ground runnin', I ain't playin'
Put a hundred bricks in the van
Give a thousand pounds to my man
Blow the money fast as I can
Signed to the streets, no advance
Bitches tryna rip me out my pants
'Cause they heard a youngin' gettin' bands
They don't know that I ain't goin' for nothin'
Only gave the bitch a couple hundred
Big dawg, nigga, you a runner
Run off on the plug, change my number
Drop top coupes for the summer

[Chorus]
Yeah, that's my dawg for sure (My dawg)
Yeah, that's my dawg (My dawg)
Yeah, that's my dawg for sure (My dawg)
Yeah, that's my dawg (My dawg)

As soon as I get there, walk in
I'ma put her in a full nelson (Yeah)

I'm on my way, I'm goin' fast

When your wrist like this, you don't check the forecast
Every day it's gon' rain, yeah
Made a brick through a brick, ain't whip up shit

From the streets, but I got a little sense
But I had to go coupe, no brain (Coupe, no brain)
Ain't worried 'bout you, I'ma do what I do
And I do my thing (Do my thing)

[Verse 1]
Bought her brand new shoes, told her kick rocks
Don't stand too close, diamonds kickbox
Think red means go so I don't stop
I know they wish they could catch me, but keep wishin'
You think I done turned into a fiend for these bitches
Tryna stuff as much as I can in these britches
Made your bitch fuck on my friend, it's no difference
I ain't never popped no Xan, I sip sizzurp
If I ever have to tell on the gang, I won't do it
If I put it on a song, I seen it or been through it
I can't put it in my song, I know how the feds move
Scream free all of the ahks but I ain't no FamGoon
Gave my mama ten bands, sent her to Cancún
Got the crowd goin' dumb but I ain't no damn fool
If I went in there and did it and made it, you can too
We done came a long way from broke and sharing shoes

[Chorus]
When your wrist like this, you don't check the forecast

And I do my thing (Do my thing)

[Verse 2]
Got a quarter million dollars in a book bag
New Era, I'm a dope boy, no cap
I'm living my best life for real
Just left the dealership, no tag
If we opposite, it won't work, it won't last
Get an opposite knocked off, toe tag
Ain't been home in a month, got my ho mad
They need me in the trap but I can't go back
I jumped off the porch with a hundred dollar slab
I got M's in the bank, give a damn what they think
Every vibe I ever shot my shot at, caught it
Everything you ever seen me riding in, bought it
Big dawg status, I ain't gotta sell drugs
Put my craft into rap then I took off, yeah
New G-Wagen, no key, this a push-start
I can hit the gas, make it disappear

[Chorus]
When your wrist like this, you don't check the forecast

These rappers is actors, they life is in scenes (Cut, cut, cut)
You catch me in traffic, got pipes with the beams
Got so many clips that I could make a movie
Herb got the Uzi up under the Coogi
Them niggas with you they look like some goofys
Gon try to rob me, you gon have to shoot me

[Verse 2: Lil Herb]
Nigga tryna rob me? That will never happen
Keep my Smith & Wesson
Hollows to his chest and someone call a reverend
Taught that boy a lesson, here come 911
Stand right over here check him if you ain't check him
Fo' Nickle jam, damn he caught a blessing
Better not come through flexing all my niggas reckless
If you looking for us, just pull up on Essex

[Verse 3: Lil Bibby]
I trap on the corner no matter the weather
A stack for the sweater, I trap in Margielas
Shooters they with me they pack a Baretta
She let me fuck from the back when I met her
That .357 will send you to heaven
These niggas is tellin my niggas is felons
My bitches dyking like they name was Ellen
Laughing at niggas like they name was Kevin

[Verse 4: Lil Herb]
Aye, codeine what I'm sipping,  gas what I'm inhaling
Posto what you smelling
Rollin up dutches in the living room got my momma yelling
Chill out, why you trippin, fuckin up my session?
Here a couple 100's go watch channel 7
Momma knew I was the man since I was 7
Therefore she don't give a damn about the present

[Verse 5: Lil Bibby]
I hop on the track, you could see what I'm spitting
You niggas wouldn't believe how I'm living
I don't think they could take the heat in the kitchen
I pray my young niggas get freed out the prison
My block is hot, the police is tripping
My niggas savage, don't need a religion
I see niggas oppin then I'm going shopping
I pop out the cut then I'm squeezing and dipping

[Verse 6: Lil Herb]
Hah, and we call that completing the mission
You know everywhere we go got like 2 or 3 poles
Shoot the bitches if you look suspicous

[Verse 7: Lil Bibby]
Play with me, you gon sleep with the fishes
No them killers don't shoot from a distance
And them niggas ain't leaving no witness
Eat up tracks man this beat was delicious

[Hook: Both]
That fuck nigga ain't gon shoot
Niggas is cappin, they say that they savage
But I ain't heard nothin bout you
That fuck nigga ain't gon shoot
They say that they trappin, they claim that they got it
But I ain't heard nothin bout you

[Verse 8: Lil Herb]
Before me and Bibby had verses and show money pilling
We were just young niggas wilding
Even though I be rapping about murders and violence
When the police come, I'm silent
Louie V on my shirt, and Gabana my shades
Versace my belt, I be stylin
Your bitch says she in love with my "Hot Nigga" verse
Now she sucking my dick from freestyling

[Verse 9: Lil Bibby]
I'm still puttin on for my city
Fuck niggas rapping like Bibby
Still ride around with my glizzy
Pull up and do a nigga like Ricky
Said you can't get out of this game
End up murked like Caine
Y'all niggas be looking like stains
Yung Berg I'll take a nigga chain

[Hook][Chorus: Lil Bibby]
Hunnid deep with the crew, that's how we move (yeah)

That's how we move, yeah, that's how we move

[Verse 1: Lil Bibby]
I'm a rap god, I trap hard, this shit ain't that hard
They act hard, let the MAC spark, turn niggas to track stars
It's no limit, I'm gon get it, don't sneak diss on that squad
Fuck a bitch about 4 minutes, won't waste time with that broad
Young niggas, dope dealers, some of my niggas crack cards
Niggas talking that tough talk and it's shots fired at that boy
Young niggas we savage, catch a nigga in traffic
Niggas dying in my city, they like, "please stop the madness"
M.O.E that's how it be, I put this money shit before me
And my lil' homie just did three, just let all my niggas free
I've been riding 'round with that heat but I've been tryna keep the peace
All these foot soldiers in these streets trying to get a name off me
Trust me, you don't want that beef, it's bodies on that heat
And the last nigga that tried it may his soul rest in peace
Nigga, you don't want that beef, my niggas won't go sweet
And the last nigga that tried it may his soul rest in peace

[Chorus: Lil Bibby]
Hunnid deep with the crew, that's how we move (yeah)
My young boys got that tool, that's how we move
Out here trapping, fuck that school, that's how we move (yeah)

That's how we move, yeah, that's how we move

[Verse 2: King Louie]
Man, I ain't with that fuck shit, tell a fuck nigga suck dick
Sneak dissing on the internet, will get you whacked in public
Balling hard no sub shit
, 
cracking cards all dub
 shit
V12 I'm a minute man
, ride with blickers in a minivan
Arm, leg, leg, arm, leg, 
spot an opp and then we get him dead
Finessing bitches I may renig. Other words she gave free head
On my operation goon shit, I'm someone you should get in tune with
Smoking dope in a foreign whip, dirty money got a nigga clean
Open heads in the magazine, turn a party to a murder scene
If I send them then they murdering: silent shots, they ain't heard a thing
M.O.B won't give a bird a wing
, straight drop then hit the lean
Double trigger, 40 with a beam will really show me what a nigga mean
Face shots on the back block, try to run, get your back popped
AK make a MAC stop
, flip a nigga like a laptop
30 shot got my hand hot, law come we ain't saying shit
We ain't on that playing shit, we'll come through spraying shit

[Chorus: Lil Bibby]
Hunnid deep with the crew, that's how we move (yeah)
My young boys got that tool, that's how we move
Out here trapping, fuck that school, that's how we move (yeah)
That's how we move, yeah, that's how we move
Hunnid deep with the crew, that's how we move (yeah)
My young boys got that tool, that's how we move

[Verse 1: Lil Bibby]
Tell that fuck nigga, "get lost"
Don't you wanna fuck with a real boss?
Catch a flight, we could dip off
When I pulled up, he was pissed off
And I don't mean to get too explicit
But shorty know I get the juices drippin'
I don't really care if dude hit it
She say, "he ain't hittin' it like you hittin' it"
He broke your heart, I'mma fix that
I'mma go down, I'mma lick that
Your ex-man wasn't with that
I'mma try to make you forget that
That nigga was a fool
Didn't know what to do
Girl, you need somethin' new
I'm tryna fuck with you
I put it down, mini-skirt
I just pull it down, I'm out front
If you don't want him to find out
I just pull around
Who gives a fuck if he find out?
Boy put that nigga in timeout
As a matter of fact, go and tell that nigga you mine now
I don't give a fuck

[Hook: Jacquees]
I don't give a fuck, oh yeah

[Verse 2: Tink]
I can keep secrets
I love when you're deep in my tummy
Deep as the ocean, we're fucking and moaning like mummies
All I wanna know
Is how the fuck am I gonna get away with this one?
Cause I wouldn't be surprised if he strangled me
Kiss me on my thigh while you play with me
That's what keeps me here, lyin' to my man
Cheatin' in his bed, what if he finds out?

[Bridge: Jacquees]
That nigga ain't gonna do shit
That nigga ain't gonna do shit
Fuckin' with your bitch
You just shut up and take this dick
Oh, you just lay back and take this dick
Fuckin' with your bitch

I don't know what the fuck wrong with these niggas man
Somebody tell me, please tell me, I don't know
It just, I don't feel these niggas

[Chorus: Pat Benatar]
We are strong, no one can tell us we are wrong
Heartache to heartache we stand
We are strong

[Verse 1: Lil Bibby]
Yea, I'm the young nigga with the sick flow
They watchin' how I move cause they know I get dough
Posted on the block, stuntin' with my kin folks
Nigga, you ain't talkin' money what the fuck you here for?
When I'm finna cop a crib somewhere by the rich folks
Same old young nigga used to kick doors
The whole world love me cause they know my shit cold
If not, I switch hoes every time I switch clothes
Pockets got knots in 'em, keep a couple Glocks near 'em
Long ass clip, know it got a lot of shots in 'em
Keep a bad thot with 'em, killas from the block with 'em
Pussy ass rap niggas always got the cops with 'em
That's why I can't fuck with 'em, never put my trust in 'em
How they gone react when a nigga get to bustin'?
Couple shots fired, watch the niggas get to runnin'
Niggas sneak dissin' so I just say fuck it

[Verse 2: Kevin Gates]
Really said fuck 'em, this is not a rap song
Boost Mobile Curve, this is not a TracFone
Contract free, what a nigga trap on
Inner tube, cocaine with the mustard on a couple
Pray the Lord keep me safe from who I fuck without a rubber
Prayer make me cold hearted, I don't ever wanna love again
Sacrificing random money, up and bought another Benz
Brother got murdered, I'll never have another friend
Now I'm blowing loud when our lounge got emotional
At times but the drugs help a motherfucker tuck 'em in
Diamonds in my teeth will help me represent the struggle
People in position recognize a nigga muscle
When you come up in the slums having nothing make you humble
Stomach rumble learned to kill without a question in the jungle
Scary ass rappers when I leave a nigga mumble
Got it out the mud, they respect a nigga hustle

[Bridge: Kevin Gates]
I be tellin' my little brother
"Mane look you got a whole promising future in front of you"
He be ready to flash out and you know, go with his move
I really don't feel right givin' no good advice cause I'm in the streets thugging
I can get killed or go to jail any day
Shit, but by any means, we gonna fucking eat

[Chorus: Pat Benatar]
We are strong, no one can tell us we are wrong
Heartache to heartache we stand
We are strong

[Verse 3: Lil Bibby & (Kevin Gates)]
Aye Gates, where should I start with 'em?
I can tell these young boys ain't got no heart in 'em
Niggas funny, you don't even like to talk with 'em
(Me either but we gotta play it smart with 'em
Man fuck 'em in they ass, we finessin' for the check
If they get outta line they might get one in the neck)
Lay a nigga down, then skeet off in the 'Vette
Leave a nigga wet, I can't take no disrespect
(Loaded Mac-11, Bibby come through with the Tech
Shoulder play amazing nigga wanna get some wreck
Say you want us dead? You won't take another breathe
All I know is us, I don't see nobody else)
Did it on my own, I don't need nobody help
I was on the block movin' P's by myself
Chasin' after cash, everything movin' fast
Gotta get it while you can cause you know it won't last
(Rap don't work, Back to standin' in the trap
On the phone, in the kitchen, cookin' wearin' slabs
Nigga want four, I'mma hit him for the 40
40 Grand a bird, yea, a nigga been retawdid
Me and Bibby in the building, life of the party
Know it's got a name but I don't know what to call it)

[Chorus: Pat Benatar]
We are strong, no one can tell us we are wrong
Heartache to heartache we stand
We are strong[Hook: Lil Bibby]
I got snow, I got dro
Everything for the low
I be posted by that store, everything must go
Everything must go, every fiend must know
I got three for the ten, give em one for the four
Let them know, I got coke, everything for the low
What you need? call bro, gotta go back to the store
Every fiend must know, everything must go
Give em three for the ten, maybe one for the four

[Verse 1: Lil Bibby]
Everything for the low, bet they thinking I don't make much
A few days the work gone, y'all boys take months
I save up, I don't take fronts, no rotation we face blunts
Posted up, got killers with me and I dare a nigga to say something
They like "Bibby you intelligent, coulda' been a president"
I'd rather be a dope boy, I really love selling shit
My last batch was fucked up, I think I need some better shit
Ain't nothing but cocaine and choppers at my residence
Swear my manners on one track, you ain't talking money it's irrelevant
And I only fuck with about two niggas cuz you niggas be telling shit
If the block hot I don't come around, snitch niggas get dumped down
Let the forty cal go baw! baw! about thirty more of them gun sounds

[Hook]
I got snow, I got dro
Everything for the low

[Verse 2: Lil Bibby]
Couple bands in my jeans, balling hard with my team
Rack full of them one's, I be serving all of them fiends
Pull up murder scene, with the girl of your dreams
40 Glock with that beam, robin jeans with them wings
Say don't fuck around with them no limits, you fuck around and get smoked
And if you fuck around and get two fresh then you fuck around and get poked
It ain't no joke, niggas gon blow, straight AK everybody hit the floor
All black mask ain't nobody gon know, bibby got crack nigga do you wanna smoke
Yeah, my plug is a redneck, get them pounds in shout out fed-ex
Get in the way of that count nigga, got a TEC-9 I'm spraying that
I ain't slow, quit saying that, I just don't know where my head at
And if you talking shit on yo block that's the same place you'll be laying at

I got snow, I got dro
Everything for the low[Intro]

Bitch I'm an OG, but I'm quick to pull it like a youngin'
In my pockets, all hundreds, run up on me, bitch I'm drummin'
I was thuggin' on the corner with my niggas, came from nothin'
Fuck these bitches, I don't trust 'em, I'm a dog, fuck her cousin
They like, "Goddamn Bibby why you still on that block shit?"
Get you shot quick 'round them niggas I don't rock with
I seen niggas turned Christian when they feel that hot shit
Thought you was a savage, now you on that Lord watch shit
Give a fuck if you box well, I got hot shells
Drop Ls, pull up back to back and give your block hell
Pistol whip your kids, I'm a demon, I'ma rot in Hell
Do the time, I will not tell like I'm Vondell

[Verse 2]
Mama always told me that the streets ain't got no love for you
Niggas get in jam, start tellin' on their blood brother
Need the type of homies like Edai, do a dub for you
Niggas stand around, they ain't workin', they just bloodsuckers
Love my lil' brother cause he always keep it real with me
If it fall down, he gon' be right there to build with me
Right back in the field with me, robber, he gon' kill with me
And we get into it every week, but he still with me
And I'm eatin' steak now, but I'm with that beef shit
Fuck these old niggas, they can't tell me 'bout no street shit
Love the ones you starve with, them the ones you eat with
I don't trust these bitches, only Nina who I sleep with

Nigga you can't hang, you ain't gang, gang
You can't hang, nigga you can't hang, you ain't gang, gang
Nigga you can't hang, you can't hang, hang
You can't, you can't hang, you ain't gang, gang

[Interlude]
See you ridin' 'round flexin' and shit with all them guns, boy. Lord knows you got a license for every one of them bitches. Stop flexin', boy. You ain't tryna catch nothin'. Ayy, ayy

[Verse 3]
All these niggas 'round card crackin', we just call that broad trappin'
I was in the field with my youngins, where it's all action
I just play my part, goin' hard for the squad
If a nigga play with me, he gon' have to meet his god
And I'm still ridin' through the hood, grippin' on the steel
Give a fuck 'bout how you feel, they know why I kept it hard
Fuck the police and the serge'
If they ask me 'bout a murder, I just tell 'em I was blind
Like my last name was Charles
Talkin' way before hip-hop, pounds in a Ziploc
White Shawn and Marley doin' drills, got the strip hot
I was shootin' dice, tryna come up on a big knot
You was in the class crackin' jokes like you Chris Rock

[Hook]
Nigga you can't hang, you ain't gang, gang
You can't hang, nigga you can't hang, you ain't gang, gang
Nigga you can't hang, you can't hang, hang

Look.. Say, lemme talk to you real quick, look...

[Hook: Lil Bibby]
Uh! Say, girl you fine
I'm tryna make you mine
I ain't tryna waste no time
Hop in my ride, got a whip parked outside
Got a condo, we can go slide
Know I got pride, but I put that to the side
Think, I need that on my side
Look at them thighs, look at that waist (aye)
Look at them hips (look)
Look at that face

[Verse 1: Lil Bibby]
Yeah, she know that I'm a thug, I ain't goin' on a date
We can smoke a lil bud, you can come to my place
Usually after I fuck, I'll tell a hoe to skate, but shorty so bad I just want you to stay
I'm working on a tape, I'll fly you to the A
Know I need that when I'm in another state
Man, that shit a tease lookin' at yo face
I miss yo smell, I miss yo taste
Aye, aye, look...
I hit it, I lick it, I hit from the front, now I'm switchin' positions
I made you a promise, I'll never go missing
You need me, girl watch me appear like magicians
Girl, you the one, you got all my attention
The way you make that thing stand up like attention
I beat that cat up like I'm Sonny Liston
I say "beat it up" but girl, I'll never hit you
War with whoever
Baby, I'm with ya
Beef with my lady, take you out the picture
I'll pull up dolo, I don't need my hitters
I'll take you out like a granny with dentures
When I get older, might make me a mister
I want you with my last night like a sister
What a few kids, girl, lets have a whole litter
More than my lady, you know you my nigga

[Verse 2: Tink]
(Yeah!)
I think I got a real one... yeah
(Yeah!)
Yeah... Look, Baby I'm yours
You ain't gotta question my love, I'm around if you need me to slide and get at you
I love how we rock from the bottom to the top, you was here even when you didn't have to...
Be, fuck what they see
Fucking you slow till I'm weak in my knees
Four car garages, I put you in charge
And you love how I listen, Micheal and Pippin
Touchin' and kissin'
I bone at you, tell me you rolling
That's when I show up and do work
Scratchin' ya body, you know that you got me
We fuck till I tell you it hurts
The moment I saw you, I knew we would click, and you gotta admit I was right
The bitch you was with wasn't never on shit, and you better with Tink in your life
Stronger than gravity, this movie deserves an academy
I feel it when you deep inside of me
Baddest, we just fuck on the balcony (Awh!)
If it's just me and you against the world
I'ma be ya girl, I don't wanna blow it (blow it... blow it)
Check on the way, now we up and we winnin'
Po' a cup and you tell me you spendin'
I was true from the very beginning
We did everything that we intended
We a long ass way from them wild ass days when ya worked on the block
More than my nigga, you know you my heart and we never gon' stop

Got 300 hundreds shot when we be mobbin'
Move the fuck around if you ain't shoppin'
Bibby gambino, I'mma mobster

Bitch I'm going hard and I ain't stoppin'
Play this in the club, get it rockin'
My youngins in the cut with the carbon
Hit his top, knock his brain out his noggin
They know I run the town while you joggin'
Pussies want to go to war, send some shots then
In the kitchen, whippin' with the wrist!
At 15, Credo taught me this shit
Told me bibby, you got to do it like this!
Shake the dope, seroquels in the mix
And my young niggas steady catchin' bodies
Flip on, they can't do me like I'm Bobby, Huh!

My young niggas they rockin' out
No drive-bys, we hoppin' out
Got thirty shots in my clip then it's about 25 I'm poppin' out
I'mma get low but I'mma keep five, never know might need mine
Just in case shit get real, have to let them off and have speed time
My bitch bad like Keisha, and every night I'll eat her
Her hair long, her ass fat, she ain't even got no visa
35 for a beat, give me like 8 bands for a feature
Every time that I step out, be fresh as fuck like Easter
I'm gone...Produced by C-Sick

[Verse 1: Lil Bibby]
They say I'm from a place where niggas don't make it out
Best thing to do is get your cake and bounce
Word around town, bucks made it now
But I'mma go hard til they take me out
And I'm ridin' with them goons cause the goons gone shoot
Think White Shawn  don't want a new coupe
If a nigga was a threat then that boy'll be through
Twenty on his head, what the fuck he gone do?
I ain't duckin' no action, I ain't just rappin'
Young niggas clapping, we can make it happen
Learned mathematics, from fucking with crack addicts
Was gone for a minute now a nigga back at it
I kill for the dough, still kick it though
Still got smoke and it's still for the low
In the field with the shit, I'm still with the shit
Niggas know Bibby, I'm as real as it get

[Interlude]
Hold up
(Bibby what's up bro?)
Niggas round here talk crazy bout what they'll do to a motherfucker
(Like what?)
You think I'm worried about a nigga man?
We got more choppers (check), more lawyers (yup), and I'll die bout my shit

[Verse 2: Lil Herb]
I'm from a city where they forever hate
Young nigga wanna see better days
Lotta nights I coulda seen Heaven gates
God stay with me but I never pray
I keep my gun on me, I ain't never safe
And I'mma let it spray naw I won't hesitate
Eating meals with the steel cause it's real in the field
Bitch it's kill or be killed, I don't live a better way
Without a doubt I go hard for my niggas
Roc Block, Kobe Squad them my niggas
And yea I got an open heart for my niggas
Still gotta keep a Glock for my niggas
Can't stop em once you startup my niggas
Gettin' money, fuckin' starts with my niggas
They ain't tryna play the part of my niggas
Then I might have to depart from my niggas

[Interlude]
Look it's like what's best for everybody else ain't always whats best for you my man. Can't hand feed no sharks nigga. Still Never Leave My Brothers though

[Verse 3: Lil Bibby + 
Lil Herb
]
Young nigga so sick, need a check up
On the road, Bibby tryna run a check up
Gettin' money, all these hoes wanna sex us
Nigga out of town, still throwin' sets up
Use your head 'fore I leave it on the curb
This real talk, this is not just some words
Niggas sneak dissin'? Man that nigga got nerves
Had to call to the city, check up on my nigga Herb like
What up bucks? 
I'm ridin' over east with it on me
I still gotta look to my left and my right
Niggas want me to sleep by my lonely
I'm riding and smoking and thinking
I'm only 19 but I feel like a grown-up
Aye Lil Bibby look at the mess that we made
All these other MCs tryna clone us
Ain't that a bitch
In my face, on my dick
Big face on my wrist shit be makin' 'em sick
Start hatin' and shit
Man I think they just wanna see a nigga trip
Then I had a thought right when I was bout to flip
Gotta calm down, let me hit my nigga TIP like[Produced by Luca Vialli]

[Intro]
Huh, I say we back on that other shit
Squad shit, that gang shit
Huh, look, check

[Verse 1]
I feel like a God or a king
In the Chi bet you ride with them things
See an opp then we makin' a scene
Hundred shot, put your block on the screen
You an opp if you not with the team
I just went copped a few Glocks with the beams
I just talked to 2Pac in a dream
Told me "keep grindin', keep doin' your thing"
Back in this bitch, I got weight on my shoulders
Bitch I'm No Limit, don't play with my soldiers
Check my truck, I got the k, and some groceries
If I catch an opp then I'm fuckin' him over
Don't fuck with witness unless they Jehovah
We want your block, we gone take this shit over
Young nigga get off the weight like I'm Oprah

[Bridge]
They callin' me Bibby The Great
I just might pull on your block in a Wraith
I hang with the lions and apes
Dressed up in Bape, pipes on our waist

[Verse 2]
I get the drop where he stay
Come in your house for the safe
Send all your shooters my way
I go Tony Montana no scar on my face
Only thing that I could trust is my llama
Bitch I don't even put trust in my momma
I'm public enemy like I'm Osama
Worthless lil nigga, pops shoulda wore a condom
All my niggas, they back on that nonsense
I get you jacked for your profits
I get you whacked with no problem
Cause a savage can't handle my conscious

[Hook]
Ohhhh, ohhhh
I can't trust a soul, I can't trust a soul, oh no
I can't trust a bitch, I can't trust a soul, oh no

Niggas plottin', yeah they want me gone, they want me gone
I can't trust a soul, I can't trust a soul, oh no
I can't trust these niggas, I can't trust these hoes
I can't trust a soul, I can't trust a soul, oh no

[Verse 3]
VVS on my chest, my heart cold as ice
Hear that voice in my head, call it Poltergeist
You a bitch like your girl, man y'all both alike
If the cops pull me over, I know the rights
Like you think you tough cause you on the pipe
Sneak diss again now they stole your life
Please do not tote the pipe, you ain't gonna blow the pipe
Show your rights, show your rights, show your rights
Hollow tips all in the sig
I might have to smoke me a pig
Coppers been killin' them kids
I swear that this shit gettin serious
So please do not play with my niggas
I went to the store, bought some K's for my niggas
I make sure everything straight for my niggas
If money get low, rob a bank with my niggas

[Hook]
Ohhhh, ohhhh
I can't trust a soul, I can't trust a soul, oh no
I can't trust a bitch, I can't trust a soul, oh no

Father God I been betrayed
Cause I been betrayed
Feel like they beat me like a slave
How many niggas been betrayed out there tonight
Plenty of times nigga
Nigga don't keep it real no more

[Verse 1: Lil Boosie]
After all the fucking shit we done been through (huh bruh)
All the pussy niggas we done tend to (huh bruh)
But it don't mean nothing when a nigga money low
Niggas will shoot you in the back and cut yo fucking throat like 
Rich and Alpo
Now its hard for me to trust somebody
Family neither they'll steal if they know you got it
God forgive me I been hurt by a couple niggas
That's why I wake up say my prayers and be like fuck a nigga
Bitches want riches so they trying to slide the rubber off trying to get pregnant
When you stupid hoes gon' learn yo lesson (mm mm mm)
Man it seem like the mo love you show a nigga
When you fall off you be like damn did I know this nigga
I'm glad I rap cuz these days they testify
Nigga ain't catch you with nothin' and he got 25
Just cuz he say he gon' ride don't mean he loyal dawg
It's Cain and Abel again forgive us father God

[Hook]
Father God I been betrayed (turn on me)
Feel like they beat me like a slave (my homie)
But I learn from my mistakes (I learn from my mistakes)
We living in the last days pray for me and make me cold hearted
Father God I been betrayed (turn on me)
Feel like they beat me like a slave (my homie)
But I learn from my mistakes (I learn from my mistakes)
We living in the last days pray for me and make me cold hearted

[Verse 2: Lil Boosie]
They criticize me huh, they talk about me bad
Ain't nobody wanna sign me, I had to show my ass
If I love you ain't no question i'd give my last
One day this heart gonna get me zipped up in a body bag
What about ya first love? Huh she played it cold didn't it?
Made a nigga shed a tear and she changed a nigga
So we fuck'em and dump'em never trust'em or love'em
No need for friends, fuck friends, friends turn into bustas
Momma gonna tell ya when that nigga ain't right (momma know!)
Momma know because she pray every night
I done and wash my hands with all this pussy shit
Niggas be hating but Boosie Boo he hood rich
On top of that I'm a Scorpio so I'm unforgivable
First time you fuck with me dog I let them killas go
I'm down and dirty cause a nigga heard me
Geefus supposed to be dead but I let him slide cause he ain't worth it

[Hook]
Father God I been betrayed (turn on me)
Feel like they beat me like a slave (my homie)
But I learn from my mistakes (I learn from my mistakes)

Feel like they beat me like a slave (my homie)
But I learn from my mistakes (I learn from my mistakes)
We living in the last days pray for me and make me cold hearted

[Verse 3: Webbie]
Feel like somebody burning candles on me
That's why that choppa in my phantom and my house got all them cameras on it
Know I'm standing under the light
So I just try to do right
Ain't been in church but I pray every night
Its like I used to didn't give a fuck
But over the years I don learned and I got out here
And earned so much to live for
My niggas tell me slow it down for real you need to chill bruh
Stay up on your grind, take your time, bring your kids up
My grandma told me look at you look what the streets done did to ya
Alot of niggas done changed on me
I came up they switched up my daughter almost died, man it all seem wrong
The only thing good is my dog came home
My mind gone my heart mad my soul so pissed
I think my niggas tried to rob me, that's some fucked up shit
Blowing killa when I ride, in my mirror when I ride by
Can see some niggas doing a coward-ass drive-by
Some of these pussies really think that they got 9 lives
You might as well don't even bust back
Cause this bitch 100 shots
And we been getting it by the pound
You know we blunted out
Something fancy stunt it out
Throwing money out

[Hook]
Father God I been betrayed (turn on me)

[Verse 1: Lil Boosie]
I got my own voice, sing my own hooks
Fresh fade, nice smile, got my own look
I just like to make people happy
Four kids, I just like being a good daddy
But I'm a gangsta and I rock shows
A people person, so you know Lil Boosie got hoes
Damn, hoes, that's a figure of speech
Get a lotta shit like that when you listen to me
As for my fans, I love y'all
Straight up, y'all a part of me, so when they hate, they hate us
Money keep a nigga going to better things
Mane, I take it to the bank, I don't make it rain
But I'm fly like Weezy
Plus, the hood niggas, man, they believe me like Jeezy
And I just like to have a good time
Hit the yo, smoke one, and put my life in my rhymes

[Verse 2: Lil Boosie]
Father, forgive me, I was raised on some real shit
So I can't sugarcoat shit, not a lil bit
Inside, I'm sad 'bout my dad
Since I lost my grams, ain't been giving a damn
But I still hold my head high, and sometimes I cry
But when I cry, mane, I don't know why
I feel trapped to be a superstar
A hundred thousand worth of jewelry to end it
And I spend it, with no problem
You don't like Badazz, then that's your problem
M.O.B., wouldn't give a damn if the hoes holla
Love cars, love broads, with a passion
I ain't never have shit, so I'm flashy
I work hard, go and get it on the road
Seven month run, 750 out for shows, get it?
I'm hood rich, still smoking that good shit
Still got the same hood clique

[Hook: Lil Boosie and Kiara]
We gon' show the world
The definition of real shit, my brother
You gotta feel it, lil hustler
We gon' show the world
The definition of real shit, my nigga
You gotta feel it, lil nigga

[Verse 3: Webbie]
I told my teacher to her eyes, I'mma make it there
She ain't even look surprised, gave me another F
Or a fucking D, happy you got a C
Fuck the world and be whatever you wanna be
Ain't nothing like a strong mind and some confidence
Whenever you step outta line, it's a consequence
We all overseas, we puffing weed
We'll make you niggas bleed, yes in-fucking-deed
747, yelling 747
On the real, we gotta be a couple miles from heaven
The world tried to pull us down, but we ain't fucking let it
I woulda did some of it different, but I don't regret it
That's one thing about me, though, I never been a quitter
That's seizure shit, crazy, shout out to the hospital
Rest in peace, ma, I'mma be on TV
Young Savage, Sweet Jones, Trill Family

[Hook: Lil Boosie and Kiara]
We gon' show the world
The definition of real shit, my brother
You gotta feel it, lil hustler

Cuz I pistol whipped that nigga for forty minutes, straight
With my shit fuck up your face
Said I was in the court I beat my murder case
They must forgot I'm the reason the whole hood ate
Think I'm crazy and get baptized call me Rambo in that South Side
Straight in school, but in the streets I was baptized
Jail charges back-to-back they like old crazy ass Boosie Boo
If you was facing that needle, you would get loaded too
Business-minded now I'm shining making this shit so real
Can't be crazy I don't got no 360 deal
Rapped about the court system cuz that's how I feel
Do wrong I'll tell you about it, that's how I is
Do that make me crazy? Huh?

[Verse 3]
Label ask my why you wanna name your album that
I'm touching down to cause hell how I answer that
They say I'm crazy for having all these baby mommas
But I was young they was fresh so I raw dogged em
Phone ringing don't even answer that's my dog calling
Some shit I'm trying to look over he ready to off em
Boosie music this the best shit on the market
Can't be crazy I got honor roll sons and daughters
Can't be crazy I ain't never toot my nose with powder
But I done thug round plenty niggas toot they nose with powder
23 hour lockdown, two years of cold showers
Couldn't turn me crazy, and couldn't turn me soft
They try to take my life, but they couldn't take my power
Nobody testified, I know they hate my power
They say she crazy, but fucking with all them baller niggas
Get your money girl, break all them niggas
Shit they ducks anyway

[Verse 1]
They call me Bad Azz, and I'll punish you
You ain't my equal, we ain't people - I ain't one of you
Since '98 I grabbed my plate up off the lunch table
I told momma I'm thuggin outside, we don't need cable
Now I'm the nipples on the titty, I'm the motor called a "Hemi"
I'm the V-12 in that 760, you niggas bitches
We real niggas with G-codes
We love to go in beast mode
We thuggin, we all got bread so if we fall we the crutches
We the do'do in the dutches
I'm the photo in the camera, I'm the pistol when it snap ya
I got the sickest Bimmer - I got the sickest Magnum
I got the sickest Charger - y'all's thirty mines forty
I told you niggas let me get me, for you get stretched in the streets
This the day that you gon'be deceased, for playin with a beast
I told Turk take off my collar I'm finna take it there
You niggas ain't play at my projects, y'all played at the fair
Trill Entertainment that's my thugs there - there's love there
D.A. don't search my house cause ain't no motherfuckin drugs there
We smart with this shit, we got retarded with this shit
Duece, duece up in my shoe I set it off up in this bitch, nigga

[Chorus]
Set it off in this motherfucker, set it off
My clique all dogs, bitch don't make us set it off
Set it off in this motherfucker, set it off
My clique all dogs, bitch don't make us set it off
Set it off in this motherfucker, set it off
You jumpin'like a frog we'll put you on that wall
Set it off in this motherfucker, set it off
My clique all dogs, bitch don't make us set it off

[Verse 2 - Boosie]
Mayne I be thuggin, I be fresh, I be super clean
With gucci shades, with some J's you ain't never seen
The race car jacket with about 80 fuckin patches
With the car to match it, Tony Stewart it's a classic
Y'all penny pinchin nigga - we spendin on y'all niggas
Call Savage from the back, come pour some Henny on these niggas
Mayne you don't wanna fuck with me
I learned from the streets, I roll with my heat
Never turn on peeps - cause I'm gutta
Came out my momma a hustla
Been through the rain and the pain now I'm a dirty motherfucker
I'll hurt a motherfucker, set it off in this bitch
Y'all niggas coughin in this bitch, we flossin in this bitch
And I walk real well, fuck goin to jail
Come home and set it off and get ya mail, nigga
I got a mind full of evil thoughts
Don't get ya people caught, by my people house - cause believe me I'm a set it off, bitch

[Chorus]
Set it off in this motherfucker, set it off
My clique all dogs, bitch don't make us set it off
Set it off in this motherfucker, set it off

Set it off in this motherfucker, set it off
My clique all dogs, bitch don't make us set it off

[Verse 3]
Oh you bucked up and fucked up and you ain't got no mind
Don't even respect ya elders, no you ain't respectin mine
But I'm gon'hit you with that 9, put some sense in ya nigga
Shoulda put somethin on yo'ass when you was a lil'nigga
But you wanna play with the real niggas, we'll set it off
Bitch you scared to let it off plus ya daddy wasn't no dog
Ya momma had more heart then ya daddy bitch ass
He ain't gon'set nothin off that's who made you soft
Bitch you wanna come in that south, where it get dumb in that drought
Where niggas wild out like O-Dog and run in yo house
And runnin' yo mouth, it's crucial watch what you say 'bout Boosie
Cause Boosie tote uzi's and his hit man foolish
I ain't never had shit, but I can fuck a bad bitch
Quicker then you can count to 6, (1-2-3-4-5-6) she hit
I don't play, I lay laws you my size I break jaws
I get disrespected at all, I set it off nigga

[Chorus]
I set it off in this motherfucker
Don't make me let it off in this motherfucker
And you gon' respect a dog up in this motherfucker
Cause I'll set it off, set it off
I set it off in this motherfucker
Don't make me let it off in this motherfucker
And you gon' respect a dog up in this motherfucker
Cause I'll set it off, set it off

Exaggerate for these hoes, boy you really think you cold

And you can’t lie

[Verse 1]
These niggas be talking bout this, these niggas be talking bout that
But they ain't never slung that yak, they ain’t ever laid in that rack

Niggas they telling lies, nigga what block you off?
I’m just a hustling ass nigga with a gift partner
You just a buster ass nigga on a trip partner
You got no juice, I got the juice, the whole world love me

Everybody want to be fly, but don’t nobody want to get robbed
For reputations, they lie

They exaggerating for these women, hoping they look at em different
But now you playing the people, since little one caught you slipping
You’s a rat, you ain’t ready for the lifestyle
When the K’s cocked and the lights out
What you know about not going in till it’s lights out?
Niggas checking niggas bout hoes, you gots no juice
All in them people’s section flexing, nigga don’t even know you
I believe in actions, no words, no weight
Nigga in LA nine years ago said he was gon' hook me up with Dre

Throughout the pain and the struggle we clique tight like brothers

If I fuck witcha I'll duck witcha, till the graveyard days

I'm looking for somebody
Who gonna be somebody
Mind made up to be a lawyer
So she gonna be somebody
She got problems and she say
"Sex ain't the only way to solve 'em"
But let's solve 'em
Let's jump in my Bentley
And cruise the city with the lights low
Go to the boat and blow some stacks
And let the dice roll

Eat what you like, big boys I'm talkin' the best
When you get lonely put your head on my chest
It figures you never dealt with a nigga my type
Who make you happy, take you places, teach you game
Somethin' like your real daddy, I'm just tryna ease your mind
I'm tired of hearin' over and over all the time
She like: "Boosie, I got a boyfriend"
Well your boyfriend ain't ballin' plus he barely callin'
So, what's up? I got a plane ticket, just me and you
I'm like: "you scared?" She late, now she packin' her bags
First class is how we do it, let me cater to you
Let you shop till you drop, spend some paper on you
Whatever no matter the pleasure
It's better then you can dream of
Thug passion from a real thug

[Hook][Verse 1]
Two times two equals four doors
On an old school
 
Chevy ridin' on Vogues
Windows up, 'tac getting stuck
Ice cold Rossi in my Quik Stop cup
Little Bruce is extra manish
I'll punch it sideways and grandmama can't stand it
Smoke 'em up at the Springs Road stop sign
And then I spin 'em by the church about two more times
Hoes hella scared, me and Mac Shawn laughing
That's when the 6-7 Cougar starts blasting
It was burnt orange with the black canvas top
I goes for my Glock, I didn't have to pop
'Cause it was K-1 getting dumb with the Israel-
Made chopper with the cooler for the real deal
Funk Mobb funk put together by a gangster
Frank Nitti done possessed this youngster
It's all good, I'll pass the dank
Then I'll slap my kit in low to make my new Vogues stank

[Hook 2X]
Mobbin' in my old school
Smashing like a straight fool
Ain't trippin' on no police
'Cause you know I'm down for the high speeds

[Verse 2]
I'm a nappy headed singer with the smoker's choke
'Cause I'm addicted to the doja smoke
I bought half a hill, forever got kill
Now do you wanna smoke with me?
The kush is in season, got your cousin steezin'
To fire up the Humboldt County greens
I'm tacked out, so don't roll my windows down
So high I gotsta put the blunt down
Have ya lit, put the wax kit on my clear
On my quarter-panel, no, you won't sit there
You'll be slidin' and I'm glidin'
And all the hoochies at the school wanna ride in
The love boat and smoke some dope
I pulls to the curb and says 'What's up, hoe?'
Only seventeen but looked way older
Hopped in my mob like she seen the rollers
I let her hit the dope and now she know the time
Poured herself a cup of that Rossi wine
A straight super bad with a barbed wire cut
And now you wanna know is I'mma tap these guts

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Triple gold Zeens with the straight laced wires
Doobies in the ashtray starting a fire
Leather insides plush to kill
Funk Mobb mobbin' through the Millersville
Six 15's with the Zapco hook
I bought my Colossus from Nanny the Crook
My cousin Darren slammed the horns under the back seat
The Alpine pull-out makes it complete
Gold with the silver base and hella coats of clear
Coke white top with the peanut butter interior
Pinstripes and mode is to catch the hoes
Every other week I gots to buy new Vogues
I love to burn rubber and punch my gas
I got a Posi rear in my four-door's ass
So if you see me spinning in the intersection
Mob your old school in the left direction
And fire up the kill me for Little Bruce
And what's up to my cousins in the seven-deuce
Cutlasses, bumpin' this
To the hoochies at the bus stop, get with this
It's lunch time, and that one's mine
I live like a kingpin all the time

[Hook][Verse]
Dick limousine, man, I need a vaccine
'Cause I'm hotter than average, I go like that gadget
An alien, NASA, I'm out of this planet
Adjusting to all of the trash that you jammin'
On radio stations, this track is a disaster
I'm holdin' back, all of my laughs, and, I swear
30% of me tryin' ain't fair
Fuck with a nigga and see how you fare
Box with fists, I box with lips
And uppercut opponent with the words
I been a nigga sick, I'm really sick
I cough up phlegm and spit it up in tissue
Been you niggas try, niggas die, niggas fry
You can't compare or multiply, look
You step to me? Takin' a risk
Start with no keys, man, I'm pushin' a Whip
And I don't need no friends, and I don't got no brothers
I'm close to a few, and I don't fuck with others
You bitches be fakin', you phony, you posing
A wolf how you actin', but a sheep with the clothin'
Majin Vegeta, I'm losing my mind
Screaming, "Fuck every nigga that talk outta line!"
Huh, move around just like them bubbles
There's always a group, but you soft to the touch
And my pen make you move, see, you silent as hell
When I walk in the room, watch how you speak
Stand on yo' feet, I'm a man
Pen burn the skin off my hand, I cop my drip from Japan
My money comin' in bands
Green on me, brodie, I'm lookin' like Broly
You really want problems? My nigga, then show me
You talk behind back then gon' act like the homie
Toasty, huh
She got the tongue of a Yoshi, yeah
Thirsty like I'm Master Roshi
I'm lookin' at titties and ass, but don't roast me, huh, wait, yeah
Posted on the wall
Just like a thumb tack, ow, uh
Watch a Nickelodeon
Or Rugrats, nah
And they go, "Pattycake, pattycake," I will eradicate
Any being intervenin'
Anything that I am seein', I am sickness, I am death
I am bullet to the chest
R.I.P. my nigga, rest
SAB jacket, they laughin' at fashion
As often, they lackin' as I am evolvin'
I'm drippy and saucy, I turn my back on that bitch
Just like a car seat for infants, huh
Expandin' all of my digits, huh
Yo' money look like a midget, huh
My shit as long as a bridge is, huh
Wait, outlandish, huh
Hotter than where you be tannin' an unfair advantage
You ain't near my level at all
Three-stock, you easy, my dog, huh, wait, look
More like a student, I'm teaching you stupid-ass niggas who do this that y'all are some booty
I'm through this, I'm moody
I direct the beat like a movie
Quentin Tarantino, sharper than a needle, vinyl, huh
Watch out, I pop up behind you, huh
I ain't really wanna try you, huh
Murderin' shit is a cycle, yeah[Intro]
I fucking love you, Jordan
I think about death often
But, I do not speak about it
I know there's things that others think about and do not speak about
That is why distractions are necessary

[Verse 1]
I don't need water, there's drip on my body
I'm driving a Dodge, ain't no need for Bugatti
Shorty got titties the size of a titan
I dive in, pussy hella tight and, uh
Blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice, uh, yeah
That shit the truth
I got a check and I spend it on shoes, huh, yeah
That's how I move (Nonsense!)
And I don't really talk a lot
I'm a knight, Sir Lancelot
With armor harder than pans and pots
I'm throwin' shots at any nigga throwin' taunts
In the parking lot, or in vicinity
Head-shots ya Kennedy
Head pop an enemy, bullets infinity
There is no remedy, why you so Jiminy Cricket?
You shaking, you timid, you scary ass bitches

[Interlude]
I don't think it is healthy to bottle your emotions, but I can't help it. I cannot talk about it, I cannot talk about it, I don't wanna talk about it. Leave me alone, leave me alone, I don't wanna ta- distractions!

[Verse 2]
I don't smoke, I'm a sober man, huh!
Eat that ass like a Doberma- hahahaha
(Laughing always hides the pain)
Bob the Builder, build an L, I'm raising hell
I'm out the shell like Bowser, huh
Bid you well but can't you tell?
I'm sort of Cell with both Android powers, huh
Pop out the wrist bet you don't got this
All these bands in my wallet, I dropped outta college
She hop on the dick on some bicycle shit
And I flow like a faucet, I know you acknowledge
I feel like Mufasa with power
The beat is the prey and a nigga devour, yum
High like I'm off of the sour, um
Hope I don't crash in a tower, yuh

[Interlude]
It's crazy how annoying it could be, or how annoying it can get to get asked the same question when something's wrong. But then to also be hurt if no one asks the question at all. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop

[Verse 3]
Back the fuck up, need my space, bruh
Why you pressed? Why you pressed?
Give it rest, give it rest
Fuck a therapist, fuck a therapist
Suck a pair of dicks
Fuck a therapist, fuck a therapist, yuh
We're gonna die, destination uncertain
But you can stick to believing in your version
But we do not know, we do not know
Where we all go when the eyes close
Pull back the curtain, see
Pull back the curtain, see
Only if you're curious
Fear the question, furious soul[Intro: VI Seconds]

[Sampled Intro:]
Those Saiyans aren't so tough! Why, you'd never see me all hurt like that!

[Verse 1: ImDontai]
Crisp like a black Yeti mic
Got a dick, so this pussy on my shit every night
Couple niggas wanna fight, take a hike
You ain't with it
All about his money tryin' get them higher figures
These niggas, they're not about the big picture
They skull thicka', you play pickup, and play witcha
Black magic when a pen slashes, body turn to ashes when a verse and your ear clashes
Yeah, evil intentions
That ain't even half what I'm dissing
I put a strain to your vision, and power up like from another dimension
With power levels that are level a billion
Eleven I'm feelin' when liftin a villain right up to the ceilin'
Infected, need penicillin
Faded away, I'm peelin', I'm peelin'
Uh
Sicker than you
You can't even handle the flu
Ain't no tellin' what the sickness'll do
Take a blade, put a chip in your tooth
Take the tip, scrape it right on your roof, uh
Turnin' blue like you Blue's Clues
Pussy nigga fix your damn tutu
Pain cause harm like voodoo
Leave a nigga bloody, no soowoo
Drive a nigga mad, he coo-coo
Feel like a Looney Tunes character
You shut your mouth when I stare at 'ya
One of them kids shooting schools in America
So, you a bitch and a family embarrassment
So, watch how you talk
You ain't nothing but a mouse, I'm a hawk
I'ma leave you in a outline of chalk
If you fuck with me
You ain't even got the balls to beef
You ain't even got the balls for seeds
No life, I see, your only deed is seeking me and talking shit on everything
Kids troll, money makers make moves
Got a troll now, probably hatin' what I do, he hit the dislike
But you watch right?
You a fan, man
Can't never understand why they let us spam you
A Stan to me
Better bow, never stand to me
Pussy niggas never on they feet, the on they knees
They know defeat, no vision so they reach to peek
They hate, they seek
Validation, really you should stop, vacation
Heard your rap, went in hibernation
I'm sleepin' and snoring your shit really boring, you better stick to standing on corners, I'm fed up you corny, you niggas like a clock in the morning, annoying, enduring your voice is many seconds of pouring
So start selling dope to them broke folks
Rapping is your hobby, you a damn joke
S-s-s-stutter-stuttering, you a slow poke
Stuttering, stuttering, you a slow poke

[Interlude]
You don't fuck with a God

[Verse 2: VI Seconds]
Aw damn, its the spitter that these niggas hate
Runnin' up on Poudii with the hammer like Triple H, prr
Another YouTuber on my dinner plate
Nigga I was chillin, Tai got me in a different state
Got me clappin at this nigga til the hammer break
Rap for this nigga, he look like Sway Calloway
What's poppin five, I got five niggas with techs
Five niggas with triggers, that's 
five fingers of death
I got five figures that say you couldn't survive with me
A coke addict couldn't go line for line with me
On YouTube, I'm the goat and I'm the best that said it
Don't get your dome bust, bitch, you tender headed
Damn, damn
And you about to have a hard day
When you get them locks popped like an arm wave
You ain't stuck between a rock and a hard place, mm
You trapped with Voorhees in a dark place
Making your soul burst, he boutta be so hurt
It's a damn shame I'm bodying Whoopi Goldberg
Look at his name, this was a suicide
I'll end up with a P.O. once we see U DII, damn
And I don't even know this nigga
But Bucket Hat gave me the call and I know this nigga
So I figured I'd pull up and put it on notice nigga
I'm no diss nigga, but you a woman, know this, nigga
Lord
Tai got me here killin' Poudii
Giving multiple clips like I'm filmin' movies
Grip the Uzi, give his fam the will to sue me
I'ma do this bitch bad and start living boujee, damn
Get your ass beat on set and off set
So take off thinking you're winning's an off bet, mm
Walk around this bitch like I'm Quavo
Scrappin for the culture and I ain't take a loss yet
Strapped up big like bronson for the action
The net watching you die, and it's all for the reactions
Get your face split like Jay and Dame Dash
'Cause me and my piece closer than Dwayne and Jazz
I pray to God that this nigga put up a fight
Or he leaving with an "L" and he taking Flight
You Jinxed yourself, swearing that y'all could see us
That's Blasphemous, I stay with big arms like Zias, damn
I'm on a site full of niggas that can't off me
And we want all the smoke, I'm feeling like Sad Frosty
1-800-273-8255 is what you gon' need
It's the suicide hotline, you feeling hurt?
Call em up before you choose leaving Earth, nigga
Not many got this kind of talk
You'll get aired and slammed harder than a tomahawk
The semi leaving you frozen if I let that go
They'll know the weapon's blue hair, XTentacion
Blood on everything, loud screams when this nigga's dead fam
With 14 in his head like Trippie Redd
Heat is gonna clap and I'm creeping where you at
Scheming with this rap, banging like Negan with the bat
Reach and you get smacked
Heard your shit I'm seeing that you whack
Murdering this cat and if he still breathing, I'll be back
Popping at his heads, hollow tips, popping off his dreads
This a clean sweep the broom got me knocking off his legs
Run up to his spot, prr, prr, gunning up his block
A warrior with the thirty bitch I'm Curry with the shot, boy
This nigga too weak like a fortnight
Your bitch riding on my rocket like Fortnite
Poudii watching like this dude is loco
'Cause I'll leave the square red like a YouTube logo
Dontai used a cheat and summoned I to beat you
I'm the God, motherfucker, nice to meet you, nigga
This my shit, bitch, it's all for one
Phlebotomist, I only came here for drawing blood
I'm the God

[Outro: VI Seconds]
C'mon, Dontai
You know you used a fucking cheat code, nigga
I know you know it
Niggas ain't seeing me boy

Green in my eyes like the nation
But I keep it real no faking
Silicone, plastic, amateur actress
That's what they do
I just be speakin' the truth
Eatin' that beat likes it's food
Yummy yummy, I am full
Dumbin' it down like a fool
Spinning they heads like a tool

Bass boomin' like a thud (ooh)
Pussy drippin' like a flood

Ice on my teeth and my wrists

Got the diamonds out the fridge
Ice on my teeth and my wrists
I got that shit like a Pamper
She like to lick like a stamp (uh)
Tight vice like a clamp
I hit that beat like a ram
Bikini Bottom, Mr. Krabs
All that money Imma have
All this money, Imma laugh
If they seeking, Imma dash
If they seeking, Imma dash
I might just run, I won't miss you
Shit on the beat like the beat is a tissue
What is yo' issue?

Today, man, we 'bout to work on this ImDontai diss track
You know what I'm saying? Young Poudii P featuring iLOVEFRiDAY, man
Mike G, you can't do this to 'em, man! (What?)
Huh?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
What the fuck? Aye, aye, aye, wha...

[Verse 1: Sad Frosty]
FRIDAY, she dissin' for clout
Call up ImDontai, we airing shit out
Poudii, his views, look like it's a drought
LOVEFRiDAY, her boyfriend like Oscar the Grouch
Diss Mia Khalifa, that shit is so lame
Poudii look like a down syndrome Lil Wayne
FRIDAY boyfriend, what the fuck is his name?
Me and ImDontai pull up in the Range
Million views on my second track
LOVEFRiDAY look like she do boat loads of crack
Poudii breath hot, he need a Tic Tac
I just put Houston right back on the map
I'm done with these fruitys, so I'm counting the guap
After this track they gonna beg me to stop
All ice on my neck, I might cop me a watch
Me and ImDontai head straight to the top

[Verse 2: ImDontai]
Ooh, straight to the top
Why they top? Why they diggin' for beef like a fossil?
Is you fallin' off like Mufasa?
Colorful dreads, need a doctor, singin' the songs like a opera
Wait, is you mad 'cause I used your beat
And did better when the song complete?
Who you tryin' to be?
Uzi or Trippie? Poudii, you trippin'
Used to be cool, why you switchin'?
ILOVEFRiDAY need to go love a dentist
Hol' up Poudii, I ain't finished, yes, you suck at rap, admit it
Heard your rap, and I was cringing
Stuttering on every sentence, uh
Froze, mmm, icy nigga, that be Frosty
They just want some clout up off me
Niggas really do it often, I ain't even mad, I'm awesome
Me and Frosty really offed 'em
It was easy, I ain't stallin'
Dropped a three like I was ballin', huh
You get this lesson for free, watch how you comin' at me
Shout out my nigga, Frosty
We ain't even tryin', B

[Outro: ImDontai]
We ain't even tryin', B, oh
Haha![Produced by Cxdy]

[Verse]
Guess you could say I'm on a conquest to test who's best with pen and a pad
Phone or a Mac or any device that you write your raps
I'm armed with a brass shield, posted up in the field
Attacking my competition with a sword I can barely wield, uh
Switch flows like I change my stance position
To spar one on one is a life or death decision
Now listen, I'm as wavy as a fucking rip in
A tide, alive, you not 'cause I decide the fate of life if you flex or try me
See, agree that I bring the heat
I melt the beat, cook it up for dinner, I eat
Shh, little nigga better hush when I speak
Cause I cuss at the weak, I really had enough of the cheek
Tongue in the teeth is really where it need to be keep
Kept
Rep the best if they asking the set
Best in the city, scratch that, best in the state
Best in the country, better than any being in space
I'm claimin' my place, fastest nigga runnin' the race
Keep with the pace, niggas in the back like to hate
Watch what you say and you a bitch if it ain't said to my face, uh
Slept on but I stay up with the best
Give me the Tech, I'ma spray them, hold the crown to my chest
Fuck being the king, we got niggas claimin' gods of this shit
And they confidence is above the level rappin' they spit?
Uh
Guess ego a bitch
Stick to rhymin' bout some ass and all the ice on your wrist
Stick to talkin' bout the grass and all the lean that you sip
And all the money that you flash from all the bricks that you flip
Stop
I make some vids and they discredit my rap
"YouTube rapper", I been rappin' way before all of that
I do what I do, get busy on the mic and I'm cute
And this horn that I toot, get them mad, yeah, this shit is for you
Uh look, I'm Bugs Bunny and it's duck season
Good luck getting buck and then thinkin' that butt's leaving
Turn on your camera, ain't no need for the flash
Just me and the mic cause a light and it ignite when I spaz
Get the picture? No? Then get the fuck out the frame
Super Smash melee hammer to the top of the brain
Blood on the scene, couple splatters muddy the screen
Give me this thing, yeah nigga, wipin' it clean
Uh, look
Snap fast on a cheesy nigga ass
Mouse trap how I crack back, easy little task
Last laugh so cold, so breezy when I pass
Need a cast left them broke, bash evidence to hash
Back lash got them heated
Heat rash, I'm a heater
Food cache, I'ma eat them
Swung dash, I don't need them
Boy hungry, better feed them
Power levels, I deplete them
Goku, how I save my energy up to defeat them
Kick to the hip and a fist to the tip of the lip
And a knee to the rib, broken wrist if you landin' a hit
And I rip through the flesh, like a whip do best
I'll take no less, carve my name deep in the chest
You deep in distress, while I'm chillin' deep in a text
Twitter, Twitter, thumb tap
Yeah, a nigga like that
You ain't hurting, fight back
Only swung a slight jab
Better beat it mic jack
Rap, mine hijacked
Bitch, ugh![Verse]
Posted in Gotham, they see me as Joker
The joke of the week, as they listen on sofa
Or blast in the whip, as the popo drive by
White guys hanging on tight to the right side
Pistol whip out, the bullet spit out
And hit a black child, the nigga gone now
RIP my dude, niggas done died so much, that I just became numb
Everybody just make memes, laughing at rape and the shooting of teens
Pull out yo phone, it don't matter the scene
Jet fuel can't melt steel beams
You pop the pills, and you sip the lean
You take a shot, do a line for the team
Niggas OD, yeah that shit is a cycle
How come all the psychos are quoting from bibles
And every thick bitch on the gram full of lypo?
The spark lit the blunt, like a light pole
I grace the beat, like the feet on a tight rope
An easy defeat if I see any rival
I'm neat with the heat, I ain't speakin' on rifles
I'm eating the beat, like I'm eating vaginal
Area, niggas malaria, sick to my stomach
I'm causing hysteria, real nigga coming
If I'm on your track, then you become the feature
Student to teacher, nigga get eithered
Thinking you nice or you dope, but you neither
Do it so well, that they think I'm a cheater
Who wanna war with an extraterrestrial being?
I swear I'm a demon, my back it be gleaming
I think I'm Gojera, don't you dare get nearer
I rattle yo mirror with ease
I start it up like some keys
Bitch call me Sora, I get the aura indeed
You ain't fucking with a G
Bitch yo ass tore up
Bag back call me Lil Mac, with the light jab
No cap when I beat pussy
No brag when I out rap any trash bag, all facts y'all niggas rookies
Messing with a vet, I ain't helpin' no animals
I am a cannibal, eat 'em like Danimals
Yummy, huh
I work all night till it's sunny, yuh
Ain't doing favors, won't get nothing from me
I'm all about business, while counting my money
I know you don't like me, you think I'm a dummy
You talk on the net, but I know you won't touch me
In person
Switch it up, whole different version
All you niggas getting worse, and I'm getting deep with immersion
Carrying y'all is a burden
Please do get better, take note from professor
The flow like a lever, I pull it, then level up
Sick of the half rapping babble, bruh
Snap you in half with a tackle, huh
Murdered this shit, where the shackles?[Verse 1]
The rain more peaceful than the sun
The older I get, the more I forget to have fun
Friends, missing only 'cause the distance
And the different decisions in job choices we was picking, uh
I barely be outside where that sun lit
Couped in my room where them thoughts is abundant
But the same time, I'm at peace, I'm happy
When I'm all alone watching vids, playing trap beats
Or hunched over on the bench after late
Bread bulging out my pocket, no ducks at the lake, huh
Pushing all the happiness away
I'm only happy when it's fake, scribbles smiles on the slate, huh
Head hanging, only focused on the sneakers
I ain't with the, "How ya' doing"s, or the fucking, "Nice to meet ya'"s
Yo', believe it or not, I ain't social a lot
Annoyed by the presence of niggas that arrive at the spot, uh

[Interlude]
And don't ask me if I'm okay
I'll tell you, "Yeah, I'm straight"
Yeah
Uh

[Verse 2]
I post up on my socials for attention
Then turn around, get annoyed when these niggas in my mentions
Asking me, "What happened? Are you okay?"
Am I okay? Pss! Look...
Is you asking 'cause you care or only asking out of habit?
I'm sorry, it's so rapid how my mood change drastic
Look, it's unintentional, emotions in a bottle, I keep it
12-pack in the freezer, hard steel like the bleachers
Minds scrambled like them cloths in the bin
And I fold them every now and again, then they multiply 10
And I fall harder than ever, deep in the rut with a sweater
I give it an effort to move, every method I lose
No intentions of making it past 30
I apologize to any fans and family that I'm hurting
But I'm hurting, too, mind going circle, few donuts
Depression got them weapons, and they really do go nuts
Draining all my happiness, I conjure up patronus
The way they tag a nigga, you would think they'd get a bonus, but-

[Outro]
(The way they tag a nigga, you would think they'd get a bonus)
But-[Verse]
Dick limousine
, man, I need a vaccine
'Cause I'm hotter than average, 
I go like that gadget
An alien, NASA, I'm out of this planet
Adjusting to all of the trash that you jammin'
On radio stations, this track is a disaster
I'm holdin' back, all of my laughs, and, I swear
30% of me tryin' ain't fair
Fuck with a nigga and see how you fare
Box with fists
, 
I box with lips
And uppercut opponent with the words
I been a nigga sick, 
I'm really sick
I cough up phlegm and spit it up in tissue
Been you niggas try, niggas die, niggas fry
You can't compare or multiply, look
You step to me? Takin' a risk
Start with no keys, man, I'm pushin' a Whip
And I don't need no friends, and I don't got no brothers
I'm close to a few, and I don't fuck with others
You bitches be fakin', you phony, you posing
A wolf how you actin', but a sheep with the clothin'
Majin Vegeta, I'm losing my mind
Screaming, "Fuck every nigga that talk outta line!"
Huh, 
move around just like them bubbles
There's always a group, but you soft to the touch
And my pen make you move, see, you silent as hell
When I walk in the room, watch how you speak
Stand on yo' feet, I'm a man
Pen burn the skin off my hand
, 
I cop my drip from Japan
My money comin' in bands
Green on me, brodie, I'm lookin' like Broly
You really want problems? My nigga, then show me
You talk behind back then gon' act like the homie
Toasty, huh
She got the tongue of a Yoshi, yeah
Thirsty like I'm Master Roshi
I'm lookin' at titties and ass, but don't roast me, huh, wait, yeah
Posted on the wall
Just like a thumb tack, ow, uh
Watch a Nickelodeon
Or Rugrats, nah
And they go, "Pattycake, pattycake," I will eradicate
Any being intervenin'
Anything that I am seein', I am sickness, I am death
I am bullet to the chest
R.I.P. my nigga, rest
SAB jacket, they laughin' at fashion
As often, they lackin' as I am evolvin'
I'm drippy and saucy, I turn my back on that bitch
Just like a car seat for infants, huh
Expandin' all of my digits, huh
Yo' money look like a midget, huh
My shit as long as a bridge is, huh
Wait, outlandish, huh
Hotter than where you be tannin' an unfair advantage
You ain't near my level at all
Three-stock, you easy, my dog, huh, wait, look
More like a student, I'm teaching you stupid-ass niggas who do this that y'all are some booty
I'm through this, I'm moody
I direct the beat like a movie
Quentin Tarantino
, sharper than a needle, vinyl, huh
Watch out, I pop up behind you, huh
I ain't really wanna try you, huh
Murderin' shit is a cycle, yeah[Intro]
I fucking love you, Jordan
I think about death often
But, I do not speak about it
I know there's things that others think about and do not speak about
That is why distractions are necessary

[Verse 1]
I don't need water, there's drip on my body
I'm driving a Dodge, ain't no need for Bugatti
Shorty got titties the size of a titan
I dive in, pussy hella tight and, uh
Blacker the berry, the sweeter the juice, uh, yeah
That shit the truth
I got a check and I spend it on shoes, huh, yeah
That's how I move (Nonsense!)
And I don't really talk a lot
I'm a knight, Sir Lancelot
With armor harder than pans and pots
I'm throwin' shots at any nigga throwin' taunts
In the parking lot, or in vicinity
Head-shots ya Kennedy
Head pop an enemy, bullets infinity
There is no remedy, why you so Jiminy Cricket?
You shaking, you timid, you scary ass bitches

[Interlude]
I don't think it is healthy to bottle your emotions, but I can't help it. I cannot talk about it, I cannot talk about it, I don't wanna talk about it. Leave me alone, leave me alone, I don't wanna ta- distractions!

[Verse 2]
I don't smoke, I'm a sober man, huh!
Eat that ass like a Doberma- hahahaha
(Laughing always hides the pain)
Bob the Builder, build an L, I'm raising hell
I'm out the shell like Bowser, huh
Bid you well but can't you tell?
I'm sort of Cell with both Android powers, huh
Pop out the wrist bet you don't got this
All these bands in my wallet, I dropped outta college
She hop on the dick on some bicycle shit
And I flow like a faucet, I know you acknowledge
I feel like Mufasa with power
The beat is the prey and a nigga devour, yum
High like I'm off of the sour, um
Hope I don't crash in a tower, yuh

[Interlude]
It's crazy how annoying it could be, or how annoying it can get to get asked the same question when something's wrong. But then to also be hurt if no one asks the question at all. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop

[Verse 3]
Back the fuck up, need my space, bruh
Why you pressed? Why you pressed?
Give it rest, give it rest
Fuck a therapist, fuck a therapist
Suck a pair of dicks
Fuck a therapist, fuck a therapist, yuh
We're gonna die, destination uncertain
But you can stick to believing in your version
But we do not know, we do not know
Where we all go when the eyes close

Pull back the curtain, see

Take a blade, put a chip in your tooth
Take the tip, scrape it right on your roof, uh
Turnin' blue like you Blue's Clues
Pussy nigga fix your damn tutu
Pain cause harm like voodoo
Leave a nigga bloody, no soowoo
Drive a nigga mad, he coo-coo
Feel like a Looney Tunes character
You shut your mouth when I stare at 'ya
One of them kids shooting schools in America
So, you a bitch and a family embarrassment
So, watch how you talk
You ain't nothing but a mouse, I'm a hawk
I'ma leave you in a outline of chalk
If you fuck with me
You ain't even got the balls to beef
You ain't even got the balls for seeds
No life, I see, your only deed is seeking me and talking shit on everything
Kids troll, money makers make moves
Got a troll now, probably hatin' what I do, he hit the dislike
But you watch right?
You a fan, man
Can't never understand why they let us spam you
A Stan to me
Better bow, never stand to me
Pussy niggas never on they feet, the on they knees
They know defeat, no vision so they reach to peek
They hate, they seek
Validation, really you should stop, vacation
Heard your rap, went in hibernation
I'm sleepin' and snoring your shit really boring, you better stick to standing on corners, I'm fed up you corny, you niggas like a clock in the morning, annoying, enduring your voice is many seconds of pouring
So start selling dope to them broke folks
Rapping is your hobby, you a damn joke
S-s-s-stutter-stuttering, you a slow poke
Stuttering, stuttering, you a slow poke

[Interlude]
You don't fuck with a God

[Verse 2: VI Seconds]
Aw damn, its the spitter that these niggas hate
Runnin' up on Poudii with the hammer like Triple H, prr
Another YouTuber on my dinner plate
Nigga I was chillin, Tai got me in a different state
Got me clappin at this nigga til the hammer break
Rap for this nigga, he look like Sway Calloway
What's poppin five, I got five niggas with techs
Five niggas with triggers, that's 
five fingers of death
I got five figures that say you couldn't survive with me
A coke addict couldn't go line for line with me
On YouTube, I'm the goat and I'm the best that said it
Don't get your dome bust, bitch, you tender headed
Damn, damn
And you about to have a hard day
When you get them locks popped like an arm wave
You ain't stuck between a rock and a hard place, mm
You trapped with Voorhees in a dark place
Making your soul burst, he boutta be so hurt
It's a damn shame I'm bodying Whoopi Goldberg
Look at his name, this was a suicide
I'll end up with a P.O. once we see U DII, damn
And I don't even know this nigga
But Bucket Hat gave me the call and I know this nigga
So I figured I'd pull up and put it on notice nigga
I'm no diss nigga, but you a woman, know this, nigga
Lord
Tai got me here killin' Poudii
Giving multiple clips like I'm filmin' movies
Grip the Uzi, give his fam the will to sue me
I'ma do this bitch bad and start living boujee, damn
Get your ass beat on set and off set
So take off thinking you're winning's an off bet, mm
Walk around this bitch like I'm Quavo
Scrappin for the culture and I ain't take a loss yet
Strapped up big like bronson for the action
The net watching you die, and it's all for the reactions
Get your face split like Jay and Dame Dash
'Cause me and my piece closer than Dwayne and Jazz
I pray to God that this nigga put up a fight
Or he leaving with an "L" and he taking Flight
You Jinxed yourself, swearing that y'all could see us
That's Blasphemous, I stay with big arms like Zias, damn
I'm on a site full of niggas that can't off me
And we want all the smoke, I'm feeling like Sad Frosty
1-800-273-8255 is what you gon' need
It's the suicide hotline, you feeling hurt?
Call em up before you choose leaving Earth, nigga
Not many got this kind of talk
You'll get aired and slammed harder than a tomahawk
The semi leaving you frozen if I let that go
They'll know the weapon's blue hair, XTentacion
Blood on everything, loud screams when this nigga's dead fam
With 14 in his head like Trippie Redd
Heat is gonna clap and I'm creeping where you at
Scheming with this rap, banging like Negan with the bat
Reach and you get smacked
Heard your shit I'm seeing that you whack
Murdering this cat and if he still breathing, I'll be back
Popping at his heads, hollow tips, popping off his dreads
This a clean sweep the broom got me knocking off his legs
Run up to his spot, prr, prr, gunning up his block
A warrior with the thirty bitch I'm Curry with the shot, boy
This nigga too weak like a fortnight
Your bitch riding on my rocket like Fortnite
Poudii watching like this dude is loco
'Cause I'll leave the square red like a YouTube logo
Dontai used a cheat and summoned I to beat you
I'm the God, motherfucker, nice to meet you, nigga
This my shit, bitch, it's all for one
Phlebotomist, I only came here for drawing blood
I'm the God

[Outro: VI Seconds]
C'mon, Dontai
You know you used a fucking cheat code, nigga
I know you know it
Niggas ain't seeing me boy

I light it up like a flash, talkin' that camera
Not talking the one that be fast
She call me daddy indeed
Not a garden, but I give her my seed
Look at them titties and look at them feet

Green in my eyes like the nation
But I keep it real no faking
Silicone, plastic, amateur actress
That's what they do

Eatin' that beat likes it's food
Yummy yummy, I am full
Dumbin' it down like a fool

Ice on my teeth and my wrists
I got that shit like a Pamper
She like to lick like a stamp (uh)
Tight vice like a clamp
I hit that beat like a ram
Bikini Bottom, Mr. Krabs
All that money Imma have
All this money, Imma laugh
If they seeking, Imma dash
If they seeking, Imma dash
I might just run, I won't miss you
Shit on the beat like the beat is a tissue

Today, man, we 'bout to work on this ImDontai diss track
You know what I'm saying? Young Poudii P featuring iLOVEFRiDAY, man
Mike G, you can't do this to 'em, man! (What?)
Huh?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
What the fuck? Aye, aye, aye, wha...

[Verse 1: Sad Frosty]
FRIDAY, she dissin' for clout
Call up ImDontai, we airing shit out
Poudii, his views, look like it's a drought
LOVEFRiDAY, her boyfriend like Oscar the Grouch
Diss Mia Khalifa, that shit is so lame
Poudii look like a down syndrome Lil Wayne
FRIDAY boyfriend, what the fuck is his name?
Me and ImDontai pull up in the Range
Million views on my second track
LOVEFRiDAY look like she do boat loads of crack
Poudii breath hot, he need a Tic Tac
I just put Houston right back on the map
I'm done with these fruitys, so I'm counting the guap
After this track they gonna beg me to stop
All ice on my neck, I might cop me a watch
Me and ImDontai head straight to the top

[Verse 2: ImDontai]
Ooh, straight to the top
Why they top? Why they diggin' for beef like a fossil?
Is you fallin' off like Mufasa?
Colorful dreads, need a doctor, singin' the songs like a opera
Wait, is you mad 'cause I used your beat
And did better when the song complete?
Who you tryin' to be?
Uzi or Trippie? Poudii, you trippin'
Used to be cool, why you switchin'?
ILOVEFRiDAY need to go love a dentist
Hol' up Poudii, I ain't finished, yes, you suck at rap, admit it
Heard your rap, and I was cringing
Stuttering on every sentence, uh
Froze, mmm, icy nigga, that be Frosty
They just want some clout up off me
Niggas really do it often, I ain't even mad, I'm awesome
Me and Frosty really offed 'em
It was easy, I ain't stallin'
Dropped a three like I was ballin', huh
You get this lesson for free, watch how you comin' at me
Shout out my nigga, Frosty
We ain't even tryin', B

[Outro: ImDontai]
We ain't even tryin', B, oh
Haha![Produced by Cxdy]

[Verse]
Guess you could say I'm on a conquest to test who's best with pen and a pad
Phone or a Mac or any device that you write your raps
I'm armed with a brass shield, posted up in the field
Attacking my competition with a sword I can barely wield, uh
Switch flows like I change my stance position
To spar one on one is a life or death decision
Now listen, I'm as wavy as a fucking rip in
A tide, alive, you not 'cause I decide the fate of life if you flex or try me
See, agree that I bring the heat
I melt the beat, cook it up for dinner, I eat
Shh, little nigga better hush when I speak
Cause I cuss at the weak, I really had enough of the cheek
Tongue in the teeth is really where it need to be keep
Kept
Rep the best if they asking the set
Best in the city, scratch that, best in the state
Best in the country, better than any being in space
I'm claimin' my place, fastest nigga runnin' the race
Keep with the pace, niggas in the back like to hate
Watch what you say and you a bitch if it ain't said to my face, uh
Slept on but I stay up with the best
Give me the Tech, I'ma spray them, hold the crown to my chest
Fuck being the king, we got niggas claimin' gods of this shit
And they confidence is above the level rappin' they spit?
Uh
Guess ego a bitch
Stick to rhymin' bout some ass and all the ice on your wrist
Stick to talkin' bout the grass and all the lean that you sip
And all the money that you flash from all the bricks that you flip
Stop
I make some vids and they discredit my rap
"YouTube rapper", I been rappin' way before all of that
I do what I do, get busy on the mic and I'm cute
And this horn that I toot, get them mad, yeah, this shit is for you
Uh look, I'm Bugs Bunny and it's duck season
Good luck getting buck and then thinkin' that butt's leaving
Turn on your camera, ain't no need for the flash
Just me and the mic cause a light and it ignite when I spaz
Get the picture? No? Then get the fuck out the frame
Super Smash melee hammer to the top of the brain
Blood on the scene, couple splatters muddy the screen
Give me this thing, yeah nigga, wipin' it clean
Uh, look
Snap fast on a cheesy nigga ass
Mouse trap how I crack back, easy little task
Last laugh so cold, so breezy when I pass
Need a cast left them broke, bash evidence to hash
Back lash got them heated
Heat rash, I'm a heater
Food cache, I'ma eat them
Swung dash, I don't need them
Boy hungry, better feed them
Power levels, I deplete them
Goku, how I save my energy up to defeat them
Kick to the hip and a fist to the tip of the lip
And a knee to the rib, broken wrist if you landin' a hit
And I rip through the flesh, like a whip do best
I'll take no less, carve my name deep in the chest
You deep in distress, while I'm chillin' deep in a text
Twitter, Twitter, thumb tap
Yeah, a nigga like that
You ain't hurting, fight back
Only swung a slight jab
Better beat it mic jack
Rap, mine hijacked
Bitch, ugh![Verse]
Posted in Gotham, they see me as Joker
The joke of the week, as they listen on sofa
Or blast in the whip, as the popo drive by
White guys hanging on tight to the right side
Pistol whip out, the bullet spit out
And hit a black child, the nigga gone now
RIP my dude, niggas done died so much, that I just became numb
Everybody just make memes, laughing at rape and the shooting of teens
Pull out yo phone, it don't matter the scene
Jet fuel can't melt steel beams
You pop the pills, and you sip the lean
You take a shot, do a line for the team
Niggas OD, yeah that shit is a cycle
How come all the psychos are quoting from bibles
And every thick bitch on the gram full of lypo?
The spark lit the blunt, like a light pole
I grace the beat, like the feet on a tight rope
An easy defeat if I see any rival
I'm neat with the heat, I ain't speakin' on rifles
I'm eating the beat, like I'm eating vaginal
Area, niggas malaria, sick to my stomach
I'm causing hysteria, real nigga coming
If I'm on your track, then you become the feature
Student to teacher, nigga get eithered
Thinking you nice or you dope, but you neither
Do it so well, that they think I'm a cheater
Who wanna war with an extraterrestrial being?
I swear I'm a demon, my back it be gleaming
I think I'm Gojera, don't you dare get nearer
I rattle yo mirror with ease
I start it up like some keys
Bitch call me Sora, I get the aura indeed
You ain't fucking with a G
Bitch yo ass tore up
Bag back call me Lil Mac, with the light jab
No cap when I beat pussy
No brag when I out rap any trash bag, all facts y'all niggas rookies
Messing with a vet, I ain't helpin' no animals
I am a cannibal, eat 'em like Danimals
Yummy, huh
I work all night till it's sunny, yuh
Ain't doing favors, won't get nothing from me
I'm all about business, while counting my money
I know you don't like me, you think I'm a dummy
You talk on the net, but I know you won't touch me
In person
Switch it up, whole different version
All you niggas getting worse, and I'm getting deep with immersion
Carrying y'all is a burden
Please do get better, take note from professor
The flow like a lever, I pull it, then level up
Sick of the half rapping babble, bruh
Snap you in half with a tackle, huh
Murdered this shit, where the shackles?[Verse 1]
The rain more peaceful than the sun
The older I get, the more I forget to have fun
Friends, missing only 'cause the distance
And the different decisions in job choices we was picking, uh
I barely be outside where that sun lit
Couped in my room where them thoughts is abundant
But the same time, I'm at peace, I'm happy
When I'm all alone watching vids, playing trap beats
Or hunched over on the bench after late
Bread bulging out my pocket, no ducks at the lake, huh
Pushing all the happiness away
I'm only happy when it's fake, scribbles smiles on the slate, huh
Head hanging, only focused on the sneakers
I ain't with the, "How ya' doing"s, or the fucking, "Nice to meet ya'"s
Yo', believe it or not, I ain't social a lot
Annoyed by the presence of niggas that arrive at the spot, uh

[Interlude]
And don't ask me if I'm okay
I'll tell you, "Yeah, I'm straight"
Yeah
Uh

[Verse 2]
I post up on my socials for attention
Then turn around, get annoyed when these niggas in my mentions
Asking me, "What happened? Are you okay?"
Am I okay? Pss! Look...
Is you asking 'cause you care or only asking out of habit?
I'm sorry, it's so rapid how my mood change drastic
Look, it's unintentional, emotions in a bottle, I keep it
12-pack in the freezer, hard steel like the bleachers
Minds scrambled like them cloths in the bin
And I fold them every now and again, then they multiply 10
And I fall harder than ever, deep in the rut with a sweater
I give it an effort to move, every method I lose
No intentions of making it past 30
I apologize to any fans and family that I'm hurting
But I'm hurting, too, mind going circle, few donuts
Depression got them weapons, and they really do go nuts
Draining all my happiness, I conjure up patronus
The way they tag a nigga, you would think they'd get a bonus, but-

[Outro]
(The way they tag a nigga, you would think they'd get a bonus)
But-[Intro: Chance The Rapper]
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, igh
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, igh

[Chorus 1: Chance the Rapper]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses (Kisses, kisses)
I miss my cocoa butter kisses

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Okie dokie, alkie, keep it low-key like Thor lil' bro
Or he'll go blow the loudy, saudy of sour Saudi
Wiley up off peyote, wilin' like that coyote
If I sip any Henny, my belly just might be outie
Pull up inside a huggy, Starsky & Hutch a dougie
I just opened up the pack, in an hour I'll ash my lucky
Tonight she just yelling "Fuck me"
Two weeks she'll be yelling "Fuck me"
Used to like orange cassette tapes with Timmy, Tommy, and Chuckie
And Chuck E. Cheese's pizzas, Jesus pieces, sing Jesus love me
Put Visine inside my eyes so my grandma would fucking hug me
Oh, generation above me, I know you still remember me
My afro look just like daddy's, y'all taught me how to go hunting, blam

[Chorus 1: Chance the Rapper]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses (Kisses, kisses)
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank (Innanet)
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses (Kisses, kisses)
I miss my cocoa butter kisses (Innanet)
(Kisses, kisses)

[Verse 2: Vic Mensa]
I will smoke a little something but I don't inhale
Everywhere that I go, everywhere, they be asking how's it going
Say the going's well, go figure, Victor's light skinned
Jesus got me feeling like Colin Powell, all praise to the God
God knows he's a pro, he's a pro like COINTEL
Check, checkmate, check me, take me to the bedroom
Like she know me well, I mean normally
You see Norma Jean wouldn't kick it with Farmer Phil
But these kids these days, they get so high
Burn trees, smoke chlorophyll, 'til they can't feel shit
Shit-faced, faced it, 15 hits on this L
Elevated, train, and the craziest thing
Got me feeling like Lauryn Hill, miseducated, my dick delegated
Rap Bill Bellamy, they said I shoulda never made it
Probably shoulda been dead or in jail
Deadbeat dad, enough of that jazz
Asshole, absinthe, thumpin' that glass
Are we there yet? Ice cubes in a bong
Rip, brain-dead, take a tug and then pass

[Bridge: Vic Mensa]
I think we all addicted
Yeah, I think we all addicted
Really though, I think we all addicted (Yah)
I think we all addicted

[Chorus 2: Vic Mensa]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my memories, my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses (Kisses, kisses)
I think we all addicted (Kisses, kisses)

[Chorus 1: Chance the Rapper]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses (Kisses, kisses)
I miss my cocoa butter kisses

[Verse 3: Twista]
I could make a flow, pitter patter with a patter pitter, juicy
Used to be in a jalabiya and a kufi
Trying hard not to be addicted to a groupie
I ended up on an album cover in a Coogi
You see, I be still a God but a goofy
You be flowing about drugs and a Uzi
That's the dual principle, sometimes I'ma be about some hoes
Sometimes I'ma wanna make a movie
And when it come to rapping fast, I'm the Higgs Boson (Yeah)
And though my style freakish
I could still break your body down to five pieces like I did Voltron
'Cause I'm addicted to the craft and I be off a OG
Know me, I'm the Obi-Wan Kenobi of the dope, see (What?)
Never scared of mean spirits, methamphetamine lyrics
Cooler like I'm off of codeine, low key
Don't be so judgmental, even though I'm reminiscing
If I don't know what I miss is
I'ma end up figuring out that it's home
And my mother and my grandmother cocoa butter kisses
This is just a testament to the ones that raised me
The ones that I praise and I'm thanking
I need 'em but the chronic all up in my clothes
And I wanna get a hug, and I can't 'cause I'm stanking
Never too old for a spanking, IGH!

[Chorus 2: Vic Mensa]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my momma think I stank
I got burn holes in my memories, my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses (Kisses, kisses)
I think we all addicted (Kisses, kisses)

[Chorus 1: Chance the Rapper]
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses (Kisses, kisses)
I miss my cocoa butter kisses (Kisses, kisses)
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses

And gettin' chased by their baby mamas

Sacrificin' everything, I feel like Jesus Carter
Hold up, I got this sewed up, my soda poured up
My woes up, I'm flippin' those bucks, they doing toe tucks
I rolled up and let the smoke puff
I lay down, toes up
Hold up, get too choked up when I think of old stuff
Move on, put my goons on, they kidnap newborns
In the streets my face a coupon
Her pussy too warm
All these bitches come to do harm
Just bought a new charm
Fuck the watch, I buy a new arm, you lukewarm
I'm Uncle Luke with the hoes
Pretty bitches, centerfolds
Tippy toes around my crib in they robes, just their robes
Half a milli' in the safe, another in the pillowcase
Codeine got me movin' slower than a caterpillar race
Fuck wrong with you? What you were thinkin'?
What you thought it was?
I just popped five Percocets and only caught a buzz
And if that label try to stop me
There gon' be some crazy Weezy fans waitin' in the lobby
Mula, baby

Young Rascal Flatts,
 young ass kid ass could rap
Fuck all the faculty, tobacco-packing acrobat
Back-to-back packin' bags back and forth with fifths of Jack and
Fourths of weed, I'm back to pack on hands
With young Cletus to pat my back
Real nigga with a nose ring, that's right
Just here to rap them songs
Rag on my hair, wrap weed in Vegas, rockin' Vagabonds
Sang a song, oh, you don't know? What?
Well, I still bang with you
Hang with you, sip drank with you
As long as I can sang with you like

This shit my favorite song, you just don't know the words

You know I rep that Stone shit

you know your hood is so clit
As God as my witness, this Will Smith spit real shit
I'ma be that, CG busy gettin', where the weed at?
Bought your girl some new kneepads
You're fuckin' with the Fifi bag
My stars, egad, she said, "This my favorite song"
"Hold my purse", now she on the floor, droppin' like it's hot
You blast this shit in Abercrombie when your work is finished
Your mom won't play it in the car 'cause it got cursing in it
Your boy like, "I'm the one who showed you"
He want his percentage
'Cause you were like, "This ain't the nigga you said spittin', is it?"
Two-step,
 
white dude's Harlem Shake
Why you laughing? 'Cause you Harlem Shake
I was never fake, I was just too good to be true
That's acid rap, we killed the track
You had your chance, and 'Bino too, ooh

Childish Gambino

My Nitty bag, my kitty boost
I got the juice, I got the juice

[Verse 1]
Chano, Chatham's own
Foolies glad I'm home
Even my haters kinda glad I'm on
Rest In Peace to my Vagabond
Rapper song, singer, suspended, subpoena
For misdemeanors, dreamer
Held back ass is lowkey still a senior
And I still shake up BO Squad, praying for my BroBois
City on the come up, shout that nigga Sosa!
Shout my nigga Fat Trel, shout my nigga Joseph
Playing Buenos Aires while they sleepin': buenas noches!
Wonder if I wrote this, 'cause it's so crisp
The most brokest cold stockbroker, winter solstice
I could win an Oscar, Russian accent husky
Acid addict, costly avid actor, Kevin Costner

I got the juice, I got the juice (Yup!)
Juice! Juice! Juice! Juice!
I got the juice, I got the juice (Yup!)

God give me one sentence more
Maybe I just gotta get suspended more?
Hashtag it, get mentions for it
Make you love it, get it trending more
And then act humble
Hear some bull that some dude mumble
Wantin' to jump dude, but let that nigga punk you
Knowin' bitch niggas wanna bring guns to the rumbles, IGH!
But I love y'all souls, don't let the juice spill Pac!
Blue pill pop 'til you feel good enough to pop
The popped bitch in the blue heels, yop!

Hunnid proof get found in a youth nigga
Stop with all the tryna' introduce nigga
Everybody know you dude, you the new nigga!
How's it feel to be you? Yo no sé
I ain't really been myself since Rod passed
I ain't even really need that shop class
I ain't really been weak since pop's smashed
I'm a genius, a mothafuckin' pop smash
Hit sensei, master

Been paid, 10 Day been they FAFSA

Jugo, you never tasted paper
Tripped, racing yaself tryna' chase the paper
I just faced a Veg-er
And you love being Kobe when you make the lay-er
'Til you realize everybody in the world fuckin' hates the Lakers
And then everybody wanna sip
'Til the juice spill, everybody wanna bib
And then everybody wanna dip
Told you I ain't worried, I ain't scared of the booth
All you can do is spit a verse of the truth
Merge the mixture with the purest of fruits
And the thirst is the worst, it's the curse of the juice!

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Ten damn days
And all I got to show for it is shoes and shows
And chauffeurs with road rage
Still the same damn ad-lib: IGH!, old ways
Still got a letterman, no practice
Still got a burner, man, no lacking
Still outtin' Jams nigga, no Jackson
No Jordan and we toe-tagging
I'll take you to the land where the lake made of sand
And the milk don't pour and the honey don't dance
And the money ain't yours
Now it's just a red pill
Got a blue and a handful of Advils
I'm the new Nitty, fuck it, Nitty the old me
So I'ma tell the buyer what Nitty told me

[Chorus: Nate Fox]
I got that mmm, mmm, I got that goddamn

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
You a laaaaaaaame
And your bitch break down my weed sometimes
See my face in the streets, in the tweets
And a Reader or a RedEye if you read Sun-Times
She got blisters on her knees, she's a fiend for the D
Even though I only beat one time
One time, it was one two times
It was two plus me equals threesome time
Shouts out to Nate, I jackball and I bop, I flex
Got neck from all these thots I sex
Rastafari them shottas, yes
House safari, mi casa, yes
Poppy fields of that popeye
She came to party, she popped a molly
Said, "Come to Papa", she said, "Papa, yes"

Chorus
: Chance The Rapper]
I've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
With the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
Paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz
But a lot of niggas dyin', so my 9 with the shits
I've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
With the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
Paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz
But a lot of niggas dyin', so my 9 with the shits

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
Move to the neighborhood; I bet they don't stay for good, watch
Somebody'll steal daddy's Rollie, call it the neighborhood watch
Pray for a safer hood when my paper good, watch
Captain Save-a-Hood, hood savior, baby boy
Still getting ID'd for Swishers (Mama still wash my clothes)
Still with the Save Money militia (I'ma still watch my bros)
Trapped in the middle of the map
With a little-bitty rock and a little bit of rap
That, with a literary knack
And a little shitty Mac, and like literally jack

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
I've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
With the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
Paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz
But a lot of niggas dyin', so my 9 with the shits
I've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
With the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
Paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz
But a lot of niggas dyin', so my 9 with the shits

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
They murking kids, they murder kids here
Why you think they don't talk about it? They deserted us here
Where the fuck is Matt Lauer at?
Somebody get Katie Couric in here
Probably scared of all the refugees
Look like we had a fuckin' hurricane here
They'll be shooting whether it's dark or not
I mean, the days is pretty dark a lot
Down here, it's easier to find a gun
Than it is to find a fucking parking spot
No love for the opposition, specifically a cop position
'Cause they've never been in our position
Getting violations from the nation, correlating, you dry snitchin'

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
I've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
With the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
Paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz
But a lot of niggas dyin', so my 9 with the shits
I've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
With the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
Paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz
But a lot of niggas dyin', so my 9 with the shits

[Breakdown: Chance The Rapper]
I know you scared
You should ask us if we scared too
I know you scared
Me too
I know you scared
You should ask us if we scared too
If you was there
Then we'd just knew you cared too

[Verse 3: Chance The Rapper]
It just got warm out, this the shit I've been warned 'bout
I hope that it storm in the mornin', I hope that it's pourin' out
I hate crowded beaches, I hate the sound of fireworks
And I ponder what's worse
Between knowing it's over and dyin' first
'Cause everybody dies in the summer
Wanna say your goodbyes, tell them while it's spring
I heard everybody's dying in the summer
So pray to God for a little more spring

[Breakdown: Chance The Rapper]
I know you scared
You should ask us if we scared too
If you was there
Then we'd just knew you cared too[Chorus]
We don't do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
'Cause she don't do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more

[Verse 1]
When did you change?
Wendy, you've aged
I thought you'd never grow up
I thought you'd never
Window closed, Wendy got old
I was too late, I was too late
A shadow of what I once was

[Chorus]
'Cause we don't do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
She don't laugh the same way no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more

[Verse 2]
Where did you go?
Why would you stay?
You must have lost your marbles
You always were so forgetful
In a hurry, don't wait up
I was too late, I was too late
A shadow of what I once was
'Cause we don't, we don't do what we say we're gonna
You were always perfect, and I was only practice
Don't you miss the days, stranger?
Don't you miss the days?
Don't you miss the danger?

[Chorus: Chance The Rapper & 
Eryn Allen Kane

We don't (
We don't

Do the same drugs no more

We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
We don't (
We don't

Do the same drugs no more

We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs

[Outro: Chance The Rapper & 
Eryn Allen Kane
]
Turn it around
I remember when
This age of pathetics
Don't forget the happy thoughts
All you need is happy thoughts
The past tense, past bed time
Way back then when everything we read was real
And everything we said rhymed
Wide eyed kids being kids
Why did you stop?
What did you do to your hair?
Where did you go to end up right back here?
When did you start to forget how to fly?
It's so natural
Just like Juicy Fruit
Works like a magic trick
Please give me half of that
We don't, we don't, we don't
Don't you color out
Don't you bleed on out, oh
Stay in the line, stay in the line
Dandelion
Do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
We don't, we don't, we don't
Don't you color out
Don't you bleed on out, oh
Stay in the line, stay in the line

I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him 'til I'm gone
I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him 'til I'm gone
When the praises go up, 
the blessings come down
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
It seems like blessings keep falling in my lap
It seems like blessings keep falling in my lap

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
I don't make songs for free, I make 'em for freedom
Don't believe in kings, believe in the Kingdom
Chisel me into stone, prayer whistle me into song air
Dying laughing with Krillin saying something 'bout blonde hair
Jesus' black life ain't matter, I know, I talked to his daddy
Said you the man of the house now, look out for your family
He has ordered my steps,  gave me a sword with a crest
And gave Donnie a trumpet in case I get shortness of breath

[Chorus: Jamila Woods 
& Chance The Rapper
]
I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him 'til I'm gone
 (Don't be mad)
I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him 'til I'm gone
When the praises go up (Good God)
The blessings come down
, Good God
When the praises go up (Good God) the blessings come down
(The blessings come down)
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
(It seems like blessings keep falling in my lap)
The blessings come down
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
(Good God)

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
They booked the nicest hotels on the 59th floor
With the big wide windows, with the suicide doors
Ain't no blood on my money, ain't no Twitter in Heaven
I know them drugs isn't close, ain't no visitin' Heaven
I know the difference in blessings and worldly possessions
Like my ex-girl getting pregnant
And her becoming my everything
I'm at war with my wrongs, I'm writing four different songs
I never forged it or forfeited, I'm a force to be reconciled
They want four-minute songs
You need a four-hour praise dance performed every morn
I'm feeling shortness of breath, so Nico grab you a horn
Hit Jericho with a buzzer beater to end a quarter
Watch brick and mortar fall like dripping water, ugh
(Good God)

[Chorus: Jamila Woods, Byron Cage & (Chance The Rapper)]
I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him 'til I'm gone
(Good God)
I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him 'til I'm gone
When the praises go up, (Good God) the blessings come down
(The blessings come down)
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
(The blessings come down)
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
(Are you ready for your blessings?)
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
(Are you ready for your miracle?)
When the praises go up, the blessings come down

[Outro: Chance The Rapper]
Are you ready, are you ready?
Are you ready, are you ready?
Are you ready, are you ready?
Are you ready, are you ready?
Are you ready, are you ready?
It seems like blessings keep falling in my lap[Chorus: Chance the Rapper]
My druggy, love me, when I'm ugly, hug me
When I'm bummy, scummy, I'm your hubby
Let's get lost
Let's get lost

[Verse 1: Chance the Rapper]
Damn, I'm in so deep, girl, probably 'cause you're empty
You can't even speak (Igh), damn, your mouth so minty
Ooh, your mama hate me, daddy wouldn't let you
If he ever met me, if he ever met you
Put that shit behind us and put this in your sinus
Mine is all up in my gums, minus all that shit it's lined with
I say oh-oh-oh-oh, you been scratchin', you been fiendin'
I'ma fix you, I'ma fuck you, I'ma get rid of them demons
It's my

[Chorus: Chance the Rapper]
My druggy, when I'm ugly, hug me
When I'm bummy, scummy, I'm your hubby
Let's get lost, let's get lost

[Verse 2: Chance the Rapper]
Damn, I need a minute, aight, leggo
She fell in love, it fell apart, aight, let go
She met her match, I let her match
She lit her match, she let me smoke
Yeah, me mad petty, yeah, me bogus
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, me know
Yeah, she knew too (Igh), it made her love it
Her pussy like me, her heart like, "Fuck it"
So dance for daddy like Gator
Ain't no partners on this trip
And lose yourself in my room
And find yourself in my grip
I'm sayin'

[Chorus: Chance the Rapper]
My druggy, when I'm ugly, hug me
When I'm bummy, scummy, I'm your hubby
Let's get lost, let's get lost

[Verse 3: Noname]
I blessed myself inside your arms one day
Swear to God there I was when the dress
And the silver buttons fade away
Miss Mary Mattress, geriatrics
Fuck me into open caskets, I wanna die with this
I wanna stop seeing my psychiatrist
She said "Pill pop, baby girl, 'cause I promise you, you tweaked
The empty bottled loneliness, this happiness you seek
The masochism that you preach
Practice backflips, tragic actress
On a movie with no screen
When the only time he loves me is naked in my dreams

[Chorus: Chance the Rapper]
My druggy, when I'm ugly, hug me
When I'm bummy, scummy, I'm your hubby
Let's get lost, let's get lost
Igh[Produced by Jake One]

[Verse]
Kicked off my shoes, tripped acid in the rain
Wore my jacket as a cape, and my umbrella as a cane
The richest man rocks the snatch-less necklace
Spineless bitches in backless dresses
Wore my feelings on my sleeveless
My weed seedless, my trees leafless
I miss my diagonal grilled cheeses
And back when Mike Jackson was still Jesus
Before I believed in not believing in
Yeah, I inhaled, who believed in me not breathing in
Cigarette stained smile all covered in sin
My big homie died young, just turned older than him
I seen it happen, I seen it happen, I see it always
He still be screaming, I see his demons in empty hallways
I trip to make the fall shorter
Fall quarter was just a tall order
And I'm hungry, I'm just not that thirsty
As of late, all my verses seem not so verse-y
And all my words just mean controversy
Took the team up off my back, like "That's not your jersey?"
Stressin', pullin' my hair out, hoping I don't get picked
All this medicine in me hoping I don't get sick
Making all of this money hoping I don't get rich
'Cause niggas still getting bodied for foams
Sometimes the truth don't rhyme
Sometime the lies get millions of views
Funerals for little girls, is that appealing to you?
From your cubicle desktop, what a beautiful view
I think love is beautiful too
Building forts from broken dams, what a hoover could do
For future hoopers dead from Rugers
Shooting through the empty alley
Could've threw him an alley-oop
Helping him do good in school
Damn that acid burn when it clean ya
I still miss being a senior
And performing at all those open mic events
Eyes closed, eyes closed seeing arenas
And I still get jealous of Vic
And Vic's still jealous of me
But if you touch my brother
All that anti-violence shit goes out the window along with you
And the rest of your team
Smoking cigarettes to look cooler
I only stop by to look through ya
And I'm only getting greedier
And I'm still Mr. Youmedia
And I still can't find Talent
And I'm still choosing classmates that wouldn't fuck
Mom still thinks I should go back to school
And Justin still think I'm good enough
And Mama Jan still don't take her meds
And I still be asking God to show his face
And I still be asking God to show his face

[Outro]
I am a new man, I am sanctified
Oh, I am holy, I have been baptized
I have been born again, I am the White Light
Rain, rain don't go away
Igh![Intro: Chance The Rapper]
Angels, na, na, na, na, ah

[Verse 1: Chance The Rapper]
I got my city doing front flips
When every father, mayor, rapper jump ship
I guess that's why they call it where I stay
Clean up the streets, so my daughter can have somewhere to play
I'm the blueprint to a real man
Some of these niggas toss they tassel for a deal man
I ain't goin' to hell or to Hillman
Igh, Igh, Igh, Igh, for my real fans
I got caught up with a little Xan
Can't stop me but it slow me though
Yeah a nigga famous, you don't know me though
But every DJ still play me though
Damn man, I don't even need a radio
And my new shit sound like a rodeo
Got the old folks dancing the Do-si-do
'Til they fuck around and sign me to OVO
Oooh, I just might share my next one with Keef
Got the industry in disbelief, they be asking for beef
This what it sound like when God split an atom with me
I even had Steve giving out apples for free

[Chorus: Saba]
They was talking "woo this woo wap da bam"
City so damn great, I feel like Alexand'
Wear your halo like a hat, that's like the latest fashion
I got angels all around me they keep me surrounded

[Post-Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
Who is you, and who the fuck is you, and who is him?
All of a sudden, woo wap da bam
You can't touch me
Na, na, na, na, I got angels
I got angels

[Verse 2: Chance The Rapper]
I ain't change my number since the seventh grade
This for my day one, ten years, seven days
A week, niggas never tired on they Kevin Gates
And if they rest in peace they bunny hopping heaven's gates
It's too many young angels on the southside
Got us scared to let our grandmommas outside
You gon' make me take the campers way downtown
You gon' make me turn my BM to my housewife
I just had a growth spurt
It done took so long, my tippy toes hurt
You can keep the nose ring, I don't have to soul search
I'm still at my old church, only ever sold merch
Grandma say I'm Kosher, momma say I'm culture
GCI, 1-0-7-5, angel goin' live
Power 92, angel, juke, angel gon' juke
GCI, 1-0-7-5, goin' live
Power 92, angel gon' juke, juke, juke, juke

[Chorus: Saba & Chance The Rapper]
They was talking "woo this woo wap da bam"
City so damn great, I feel like Alexand'
Wear your halo like a hat, that's like the latest fashion
I got angels all around me, they keep me surrounded
Wap the bam (na, na, na, na)
I got angels
(I got angels) I got angels all around me they keep me surrounded
Na, na, na, na
I got, I got angels
They was talking "woo woo, this woo wap da bam"
City so damn great, I feel like Alexand'
Wear your halo like a hat, that's like the latest fashion
I got angels all around me, they keep me surrounded

[Post-Chorus: Chance The Rapper]
Who is you, and who the fuck is you, and who is him?
All of a sudden, woo wap da bam
You can't touch me
Na, na, na, na, I got angels
I got, I got angels
